Victor Osimhen powered Galatasaray to a 3-0 victory over Trabzonspor to lift the 2024 Turkish Cup on Wednesday night, May 14. 

The Nigerian forward found the net in the 46th and 63rd minutes to power Okan Buruk’s team to a 3-0 victory over Trabzonspor, securing the club’s 19th Turkish Cup title, a national record. 

With his brace in the Turkish Cup final, Osimhen now has 35 goals in 39 matches for Galatasaray, per Transfermarkt stats.

He has also set a new club record for most goals scored in a single season by a foreign player for the Super Lig giants. 

Edo indigenes make passionate appeal to Osimhen

Some self-identified indigenes of Edo State have made a heartfelt appeal to Super Eagles striker Victor Osimhen, urging him to support his kinsmen in Okhuesan.

Family members in the community have claimed that the Galatasaray forward has distanced himself from them since rising to prominence in both club and international football.

Yusuf Sakiru specifically called on the former Lille star to assist his father’s relatives, who he says are living in poor conditions.

He added that many footballers and celebrities extend philanthropic gestures even to those outside their families, and encouraged Osimhen to do the same. He said:

“Victor Osimhen please listen to good advice here, kindly assist your immediate Parents' family. 

“It's not necessary you travel down home before doing that Almighty Allah have blessed you give what belong to Cezar to Cezar. 

“Again you are the only Celebrity that will be helping his or her people in the village, we have had Some people's before you please do the needful God will surely guiding you and you shall not fall down in your life Amin.\\"

In the same vein, Ken Igbokwe urged Victor Osimhen to follow the footsteps of football stars like Didier Drogba, Yaya Toure and Sadio Mane who give back to their community. He said:

“God pick him for a purpose. Mane is been love by his people bc of the charity works he is doing for his village people. Go to dider Drogba and yaya village and see charity begins at home.”

Osimhen reportedly offered ₦1.3 billion weekly 

Legit.ng earlier reported that amid speculation about Victor Osimhen's next club, he could make headlines with one of the most lucrative contracts in football history. 

Reports suggested that Saudi Pro League giants, Al-Hilal, had made an offer of ₦1.3 billion per week to try and lure the Nigerian international away from Europe. 

The club was reportedly prepared to not only meet Napoli’s €75 million release clause, applied to non-Italian clubs, but also tabled a huge annual salary for Osimhen.
