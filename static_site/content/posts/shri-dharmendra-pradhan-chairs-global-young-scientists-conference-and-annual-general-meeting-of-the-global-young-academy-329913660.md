Union Minister for Education, Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, today chaired the Global Young Scientists Conference and Annual General Meeting of the Global Young Academy at IIT Hyderabad. Director, IIT, Hyderabad, Prof. B.S. Murty; President, Indian National Science Academy, Prof. Ashutosh Sharma; Chairman, Board of Governors, IIT Hyderabad, Shri B.V.R. Mohan Reddy; and other dignitaries were also present at the event.

Shri Dharmendra Pradhan, in his address, welcomed young scientists from around the world attending the conference. Shri Pradhan congratulated the 30 new members of GYA who were inducted during the event. He appreciated the Global Young Academy for selecting India and IIT Hyderabad for hosting the event. He also said that the conference was more than just a gathering of scientists and a forum representing hope, purpose, and a shared destiny.





Shri Pradhan stated that for India, Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — One Earth, One Family, One Future — was not just a slogan but a way of life. India believes in science that is empathetic, ethical, and equitable, he said. He also said that science must be shared and partnerships, not patents, must shape the future.

The Minister highlighted that India’s global engagements were rooted in these values, citing initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance, the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, Mission LiFE, and the India Science and Research Fellowship as reflections of India’s vision of Vishwa Bandhutva — global friendship through science.

He also noted that the present moment is the most opportune for scientists, innovators, and policymakers to come together and build ecosystems and solutions that empower the most vulnerable. He expressed confidence that the conference would serve as a platform for channelling knowledge in the service of others. Shri Pradhan also urged scientists to collaborate and co-create with a sense of purpose and empathy to realise the vision of Viksit Bharat and advance human-centric development.



Shri Pradhan, along with other dignitaries, planted saplings at the IIT Hyderabad Campus as part of the Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam initiative. One tree honouring one’s mother is a small act with a deep message and big impact, he said. He encouraged everyone, especially students across campuses, to lead this green movement. He urged people to engage in protecting, preserving and nurturing nature for a sustainable future.

The Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH), in collaboration with the Global Young Academy (GYA), the Indian National Young Academy of Science (INYAS), and the Indian National Science Academy (INSA), is hosting the International Conference of Young Scientists – Confluence of Visionaries: Empowering Science for Global Change from 8 to 14 June 2025. This week-long event, being held for the first time in India, marks a significant milestone in bringing together the next generation of global scientific leaders to collaborate on science-driven solutions for global challenges. The event hosts 135 international delegates representing 60 countries, along with 65 national delegates, thereby establishing a truly diverse and inclusive forum. It also features the Annual General Meeting of the Global Young Academy (GYA), facilitating in-depth dialogue and strategic engagement among emerging leaders in the global scientific community.

The conference features dynamic discussions and thematic sessions on:

• Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG);

• Health and Nutrition for Global Wellness;

• Industry 5.0: Augmenting Human-Machine Interface; and

• Innovation and Entrepreneurship: Global Landscape.
