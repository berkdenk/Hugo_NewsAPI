On June 6, 2025, Türkiye marked a critical milestone in its ongoing pursuit of defense self-sufficiency and technological autonomy. In a significant development for the Turkish defense sector, Roketsan’s Stand-Off Missile (SOM) program achieved a successful test firing with the domestically developed KTJ-3200 turbojet engine. The successful demonstration of this engine marks the full localization of the missile’s propulsion system, eliminating one of the last remaining foreign dependencies in Türkiye’s indigenous cruise missile program. As global defense dynamics evolve, this achievement not only bolsters Türkiye’s national security posture but also positions the country as a formidable player in the global precision strike missile market.

The SOM cruise missile, developed by Roketsan under the supervision of Türkiye’s Defense Industry Agency, represents a cornerstone of the country’s strategic deterrence capabilities. Designed as a modular air-to-surface cruise missile, SOM is engineered to engage high-value land and maritime targets at stand-off ranges exceeding 250 kilometers. Measuring approximately four meters in length and weighing around 600 kilograms, the missile carries a powerful 230-kilogram high-explosive warhead, making it a formidable asset for deep strike missions. Its modular architecture allows for multiple variants and configurations, offering flexibility in targeting and deployment scenarios.

The journey of the SOM began in 2006, initiated by TÜBİTAK SAGE to fulfill the Turkish Air Force’s requirement for a long-range, precision-guided, air-launched cruise missile. Over the years, the missile has evolved into a family of variants, including the SOM-A, SOM-B1, SOM-B2, and SOM-J. Each variant is tailored for specific operational needs, such as hardened target penetration, electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM), or compatibility with stealth aircraft. This modularity, combined with advanced guidance systems including GPS/INS, terrain contour matching (TERCOM), and imaging infrared (IIR) seekers, makes the SOM a versatile tool in Türkiye’s aerial arsenal.

Until recently, the SOM relied on the French-made TR-40 turbojet engine, which introduced vulnerabilities tied to international export controls and geopolitical fluctuations. Recognizing the strategic imperative of self-reliant propulsion capabilities, Türkiye launched the KTJ-3200 engine development initiative in 2013. Spearheaded by Kale Arge in collaboration with TÜBİTAK SAGE and Roketsan, the decade-long program focused on delivering a high-performance, indigenous turbojet engine capable of supporting advanced flight profiles such as low-altitude terrain following and evasive maneuvers. These capabilities are essential for ensuring missile survivability in highly contested environments, such as those protected by sophisticated integrated air defense systems (IADS).

The KTJ-3200 turbojet engine represents a transformative step in Türkiye’s defense industrial base. Engineered for reliability, efficiency, and stealth-compatible operation, the KTJ-3200 empowers the SOM missile with the ability to execute complex trajectories and low-level penetration, minimizing radar detection and interception risk. In the June 6 test, the KTJ-3200-powered SOM missile not only demonstrated full operational capability but also proved the maturity of Türkiye’s indigenous propulsion ecosystem.

Strategically, the localization of the SOM’s propulsion system delivers several critical advantages. First and foremost, it eliminates the political and logistical constraints associated with foreign engine procurement. This independence significantly boosts the Turkish defense sector’s agility and resilience in the face of global supply chain disruptions or embargoes. Secondly, it enhances Türkiye’s leverage in the international defense market. The ability to export a fully indigenous cruise missile without entanglements in third-party export licenses dramatically improves the appeal of the SOM to potential foreign buyers.

From a comparative perspective, the KTJ-3200-powered SOM is now poised to rival Western systems such as the U.S.-made AGM-158 Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) and the European Storm Shadow/SCALP EG. While these missiles are technologically sophisticated, their export is tightly regulated by the governments of their origin. In contrast, Türkiye’s SOM offers a competitive, high-performance solution that can be marketed more freely, especially to countries seeking alternatives to traditional Western defense suppliers. Similar to Russia’s Kalibr and China’s CJ-10 programs—both of which prioritized domestic propulsion development—Türkiye’s achievement underscores its determination to join the ranks of nations capable of developing complete, sovereign cruise missile systems.

Operationally, the SOM missile has already been integrated into platforms such as the F-4E/2020 and F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft in Turkish service. Future plans include integration with Türkiye’s next-generation TF-X fighter jet, a fifth-generation stealth platform currently under development. The successful KTJ-3200 test opens new possibilities for expanding the missile’s application to land- and sea-based launch platforms, further enhancing its strategic utility across multiple theaters of operation.

The June 6 test also holds symbolic importance in Türkiye’s broader defense doctrine. In an era marked by increasingly multipolar power competition and uncertainty within traditional alliance frameworks, self-sufficiency in critical defense technologies has become a cornerstone of national security policy. The full localization of the SOM system—including guidance, warhead, and propulsion—demonstrates that Türkiye is not merely aspiring to autonomy but is actively achieving it. The nation’s long-standing goal of becoming a top-tier global defense exporter is gradually materializing as it demonstrates its capacity to field systems that are not only effective but also unconstrained by foreign approvals.

Türkiye’s defense industry has experienced significant growth over the past two decades, with companies such as Roketsan, ASELSAN, TAI, and HAVELSAN at the forefront of innovation. The KTJ-3200 engine’s success adds another layer of credibility to this expanding ecosystem. Furthermore, it creates a pathway for additional applications beyond cruise missiles. Future developments may see the KTJ-3200 or its derivatives powering loitering munitions, UAVs, or even tactical air-breathing hypersonic platforms.

From a geopolitical standpoint, the implications are far-reaching. As nations across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East seek to diversify their defense portfolios and reduce dependency on traditional Western or Russian systems, Türkiye’s offerings become increasingly attractive. The SOM’s combination of range, modularity, precision, and now full indigenization, positions it uniquely to fulfill this demand. Already, interest in Turkish missile technology has been expressed by several countries, and the KTJ-3200 test strengthens Türkiye’s credibility in negotiating future defense export deals.

The KTJ-3200-powered SOM missile marks a transformative moment in Türkiye’s defense evolution. It affirms the country’s capability to design, develop, and deploy high-end military technology without reliance on foreign suppliers. This not only strengthens Türkiye’s national security and strategic autonomy but also enhances its stature in the global defense community.

Türkiye’s defense sector is increasingly proving that it is ready—not just to participate—but to lead. The SOM program’s latest milestone serves as both a technological and strategic victory, embodying the vision of a self-reliant, export-capable Türkiye.
