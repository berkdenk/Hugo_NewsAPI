The second round of peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine concluded abruptly in Istanbul on June 2, 2025, lasting barely an hour and yielding no significant progress. The talks, held at the historic Ciragan Palace, were overshadowed by recent escalations, including a substantial Ukrainian drone strike on Russian military assets. Second Round of Russia-Ukraine Peace Talks in Istanbul Ends Abruptly Amid Escalating Tensions Turkish officials reported that the meeting commenced nearly two hours late without any official explanation. The atmosphere was tense, particularly on the Russian side, following Ukraine's drone assault that reportedly damaged or destroyed over 40 Russian military aircraft stationed deep within Russian territory. While Ukraine hailed the operation as a strategic success, Russia disputed the extent of the damage. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan stated that discussions centered on assessing conditions for a potential ceasefire During the brief session, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan stated that discussions centered on assessing conditions for a potential ceasefire, organizing a summit between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, and arranging further prisoner exchanges. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed plans for a new prisoner swap and presented Russia with a list of deported Ukrainian children, demanding their return. Russia maintains that the children were relocated for their safety. Despite these discussions, no substantive agreements were reached. Ukraine reiterated its demands for a full ceasefire, the release of all prisoners, and the return of abducted children. Conversely, Russia presented a memo reiterating its longstanding demands, including Ukraine's neutrality, non-expansion of NATO, and partial sanctions relief. The international community, particularly the United States, has expressed growing frustration over the lack of progress. U.S. President Donald Trump has warned of withdrawing U.S. mediation efforts if no tangible advancements are made. Meanwhile, European leaders have emphasized the necessity of including Ukraine in any peace negotiations, adhering to the principle of \\"Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine.\\" As the conflict enters its third year, the prospects for a diplomatic resolution remain bleak. Both sides continue to hold firm to their positions, and the recent military escalations have further complicated the path to peace. The international community watches with concern, urging both nations to find common ground and end the ongoing hostilities.
