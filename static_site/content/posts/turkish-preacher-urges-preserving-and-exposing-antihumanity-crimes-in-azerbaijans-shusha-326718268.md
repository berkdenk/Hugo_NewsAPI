SHUSHA, Azerbaijan, May 31. Traces of crimes
against humanity committed in the city of Shusha must be preserved
and presented to the world community, a Turkish cleric Ahmet Erdem
told Trend.

\\"I came from the Turkish city of Kars, but this is my native
land. My paternal grandfather was from the city of Shusha, and my
maternal grandfather was from Ganja. They left for TÃ¼rkiye during
the Armenian oppression that took place here in 1918. Until their
last days, they dreamed of Azerbaijan. Today, I visit the places
they yearned for, including for their sake,\\" he said.

According to him, during the Second Karabakh War, people prayed
in the mosque in Kars and honored the memory of Azerbaijani

\\"During our visit today, I witnessed the destruction of not only
buildings and nature but also humanity by Armenians in Karabakh.
This scene, the traces of this crime against humanity, must be
preserved and shown to the world. Let the whole world see this
cruelty based on real facts,\\" he added.
