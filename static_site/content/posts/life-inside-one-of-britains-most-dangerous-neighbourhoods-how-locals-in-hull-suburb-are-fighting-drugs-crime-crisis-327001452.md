IT was once the lifeblood of Hull's fishing industry, home to proud dockers and hard-working trawlermen.

But today, Hessle Road stands as a microcosm of decay, despair, and lawlessness in modern Britain.

The mile-long stretch, once bustling with traders and community spirit, now finds itself overrun by crime and anti-social behaviour.

The St Andrews and Docklands area, where the street lies, recorded a staggering 1,662 crimes per 1,000 people last year - making it one of the most dangerous neighbourhoods in the country outside of London, Birmingham and Liverpool.

Residents told how they fear for their safety while businesses struggle to survive amid an epidemic of shoplifting and violence.

Nini Thompson, 50, has lived in the area all her life and no longer trusts the police to keep her safe.

She said: 'I've lived here all my life and it's just getting worse and worse. I've seen the place go to the dogs.

'The crime levels are through the roof - you name it, we've got any kind of crime. Drug dealing, prostitution, begging, shoplifting, violence, money laundering.

'The crackhead scene is just ridiculous.'

Last week, her partner's £470 electric bike was stolen by a man 'off his face', who sold it for £50 to fund his next fix. Nini did not bother to report it.

She said: 'My boyfriend went to the chemist on his bike. A smackhead crept up behind him and nicked it.

'He fled on it - nearly knocking a pram over in the process.

'I was told pretty quickly who had taken it and I sorted it out myself. That's what you have to do around here.'

At Rayners pub, once a favourite haunt of returning fishermen, the large windows are now covered in sheets of cellophane, having been smashed not for the first time.

While a previous attack was blamed on a punter angry that the fruit machine had not paid out, this time yobs hurled bricks as customers drank inside.

Barmaid Mandy Lowe, 60, said: 'Someone just chose to put them through at tea time on a Thursday.

'Thankfully the glass was shatterproof, otherwise people might have been hurt.

'We've not idea who did it but we won't let it beat us. We've stayed open as usual.'

Like many British high streets, Hessle Road itself is now a landscape of shuttered shops, Turkish barbers, betting shops and takeaways.

Shopkeepers say the area has become a no-go zone for honest trade, describing how the area is plagued by drug dealers, sex workers, and beggars.

Jason Crumblin, 44, moved from Australia to open a giftware store on Hessle Road. Now he's planning to pack up and return to Melbourne after being blighted by shopliftings.

He said: 'Theft is everywhere. Unless it's tied down, they'll steal it.

'I've been plagued by shoplifting the whole time I've been here.

'It's a big reason why a lot of businesses are shutting on this road. They can't survive.

'It's the foreigners who steal more than the English people. I don't take my eyes off them, which is terrible and it just shouldn't have to be like that.'

Upon arrival in the city, he said he was shocked by the flagrant drug use on the streets. 

He added: 'Drugs are illegal in Australia, too, but you don't have people walking down the street brazenly smoking a joint.

'To be honest, I can't wait to go home. I'm going back to the beach.'

St Andrews and Docklands is a Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA), a term used to describe zones of 1,000 to 3,000 people created for administrative purposes.

According to official figures, the area recorded 2,458 crimes last year — for a population of just 1,533.

The bulk of reported crimes relate to violence, sexual offences and shoplifting.

Frank Moore, 58, who grew up on the streets surrounding Hessle Road, said theft and robberies were a big issue in the area.

He said: 'In the past you used to be worried about people taking the baby from the pram, now they want the pram and not the baby.

'I don't like walking down here at night, I don't feel safe. You feel intimidated - like you could be mugged at any moment.

'It's a crying shame because this area used to be great. But it's just not what it used to be.'

Father-of-three Andy Hendin, 34, told how his young daughter Sailor-Rae's bike was stolen from their front garden.

He blamed a surge in anti-social behaviour on an influx of arrivals from Eastern Europe.

He said: 'I think the locals who have grown up around here have got a bit more respect. Some of them can be t***s but most people don't want to cause trouble where they live.

'If there's a problem we will sort it between ourselves.

'Sadly, and I hate to say it, but the bulk of crime comes from people who have moved here from other countries.

'Shoplifting and begging is a real issue and the prostitution is rife.

'You'll regularly walk down the street and be offered something that's just been nicked from shop.

'You can't go out without someone asking you for money. The other day I had a big bag of shopping and there was a bloke behind me just prodding through it.

He added: 'You put your rubbish bin out for collection and then people will go searching through it. They'll tear through it and leave the rubbish strewn across the road.'

Part of London's West End known for pickpockets and robberies had the highest crime rate last year of 16,348 per 1,000 residents, followed by two other areas in Westminster and then Ladywood in Birmingham (5,777 per 1,000).

Areas in Brighton, Newcastle, Liverpool and Bradford also made the top 10.

But he was quickly forced to hide them behind lock and key after children as young as 13 began stealing from his displays.

He said: 'I'd love to have kept everything on display but I have to do it differently or I'd have no stock left.

'So, now our goods are behind the counter and in locked cabinets, which is a shame.'

Mr Casprzak has installed security measures including barbed wire and steel-plated doors at the rear of his premises.

He added: 'I've had people in the shop clearly scouting it out to see how they could get in or what they could take.

'It's crazy what you've got to do around here.

'I grew up here and it's always been rough but it's got worse over the years.'

Wary locals also told how money laundering was 'hidden in plain sight' across nail bars, takeaways, barbers and convenience stores in the area.

More than one person told Mail Online of flamboyant shop owners driving luxury cars with personalised plates - despite their stores lying empty of custom.

Genuine businesses appeared to know what fraud officers did not, pointing the finger at a nearby electronics shop, a launderette and a takeaway.

'No-one is ever in them,' a hairdresser said. 'You're telling me they can afford a Range Rover, while I struggle to put petrol in my Fiat Panda?'

Another salon owner - who feared speaking out publicly would be a green light for retaliation - said: 'We've got to pay our rent, salaries, VAT and tax. Some of the salon owners don't take a wage because they're just trying to keep going.

'They've got to compete against so many shops that don't play by the book. We can't compete with their prices, so people like us, who are honest and legal, go under.'

The hairdresser - who bears the burden of employing of a dozen workers - added: 'People across the country are experiencing the same thing. Salons can't afford to take trainees on any more because our bills are going up and we're being undercut.

'It's frightening - I don't sleep at night.

'I look at some of these cash-only businesses and think 'am I the daft one?'.

A colleague agreed, adding: 'You see them driving around in bloody Range Rovers - we can't afford that.

'But we can't do anything. None of us would dare speak out or we'd get bombs through our windows.

'They even fight and argue with each other.'

He said: 'When I first saw them I thought 'what the hell?'. How can they afford to pay the rent when they are sitting there filing their own nails?

'I'm fortunate that this shop is cheap to rent but I've still got the bills to pay.

'I look at some of businesses and they are in humongous premises with blingy signs - yet there's never anyone in them.

'Everyone knows what's going on.'

Humberside Police neighbourhood inspector Dave Lonsdale said: 'Local policing teams continue to work closely with our partners and the community, to tackle local issues and support a safe, welcoming environment for everyone who lives, works, and visits the area.

'Hessle Road is a vibrant and busy part of the city with a strong community at its heart and the local neighbourhood policing teams are a part of this.

'They know the area well and work closely with the local authority as well as charities to fully understand the wider picture and bring about long-term sustainable solutions.

'We remain committed to tackling issues within the community through proactive policing, visible patrols and early intervention to address immediate challenges and their underlying causes.

'It is important that we continue to work with the local community to address concerns and tackle issues and I encourage anyone with any information surrounding criminality to get in touch with us.

'I would also encourage residents to sign up for My Community Alert to receive regular email updates about what is happening in your local area you can do this at www.mycommunityalert.co.uk.'

A spokesperson for Hull City Council said: 'We take the concerns of residents extremely seriously and community safety remains a top priority for Hull City Council. 

'From regular police patrols to new investment and community events, we are working with Humberside Police and our other key partners to deliver a coordinated response in the area. 

'We are listening, we are acting, and we are investing in solutions to make the city a safer place to live.'
