BOSTON, MA, UNITED STATES, May 27, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- BDMT Global, an award-winning, Boston-based group of global business development and marketing experts with a turnkey market expansion expertise for global industry innovatorsâannounced the BDMT Global + MEDevice Boston Innovator Summit 2025, a curated program designed to drive collaborations between global MedTech innovators and U.S. ecosystem players to solve critical challenges. The Innovator Summit, hosted in partnership with MEDevice Boston on September 30 â October 1, marks the next pillar of BDMT Globalâs DAC Global Bridge Series to provide a one-stop destination for collaboration opportunities between companies, which will be expanding to additional leading trade shows. âThe U.S. healthcare market is shifting. New tariffs and âMade-in-Americaâ policies demand localized strategies. Stricter reimbursement rules require agile, on-the-ground support,â said Suzy Im, U.S. Trade Show and Business Development Expert, and Managing Partner at BDMT Global. âThis Summit offers U.S. manufacturers and MedTech leaders a unique forum to connect with global innovators showcasing cutting-edge technologies, while creating opportunities to develop early relationships with Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) to build market credibility and acceptance, opening the door to licensing agreements, local production partnerships, and product collaborations.â Focused on Digitization, Automation, and Cross-Industry Collaboration, and launched in 2023 with Mayo Clinic Laboratories as the first sponsor, DAC is BDMT Globalâs signature program designed to help global innovators across industries overcome entry barriers and achieve scalable success in the U.S. Through its partnership with MEDevice Bostonâranked among the top three MedTech sourcing events in the U.S.âBDMT Global is launching the first in a series of DAC Global Bridge activations that will extend to other major events in 2026 and beyond. âMEDevice is pleased to announce its partnership with BDMT Global to introduce top emerging healthcare innovations that can deliver strong value through collaboration with our partners and participants at our Boston event this fall,â said Melissa Magestro, VP, Informa Markets Engineering. âThis partnership aims to accelerate meaningful connections between leading Korean MedTech innovators and the U.S. ecosystemâincluding OEMs, suppliers, KOLs, and industry leadersâwho are actively seeking new technologies and strategic partnerships to address todayâs healthcare challenges. With BDMT Globalâs proven expertise in bridging collaboration gaps between global innovators and local stakeholders, weâre building a powerful platform for cross-border innovation, market expansion activation, and transformative partnerships.â âThe Innovator Summit isnât just an eventâitâs a front row seat to selected global MedTech technologies before they hit the broader U.S. market,â said Im. âSouth Korea is especially compelling, with a reputation for strict regulatory standards, rigorous quality control, and fast-moving innovation. For U.S. manufacturers, OEMs, and investors, this is a valuable opportunity to source proven, high-quality technologies and forge early partnerships that align with reshoring goals and pipeline needs.â Leading healthcare innovators from South Korea will be invited to participate in the Summit to gain global exposure as part of the expanding DAC movement. The Summit is designed for MedTech innovators and global companies seeking to build meaningful technology collaborations and business partnerships to bring forward new applications that can serve as essential solutions for the U.S. healthcare system. Global MedTech innovators, OEMs, component makers, and more will have the opportunity to explore synergies with U.S. MedTech leaders and other key ecosystem players at the Summit.
