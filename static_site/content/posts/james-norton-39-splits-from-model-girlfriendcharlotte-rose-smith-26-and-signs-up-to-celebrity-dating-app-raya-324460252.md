James Norton is back on the market, it has been reported. 
The stage and screen star, 39, is said to have split from his girlfriend, model and artist Charlotte Rose Smith, 26. 
The Happy Valley actor has reportedly been spotted on exclusive celebrity dating app, Raya.
The profile in question is said to feature photos of Norton with a shaved head – a dramatic new look he's adopted for his upcoming role in Sunny Dancer, currently being filmed in Scotland with co-star Bella Ramsey.
MailOnline has contacted James' reps for comment. 
James, who is a strong contender to be the next James Bond, started dating Charlotte late last year and was pictured out with her on several occasions.

James Norton is said to be back on the market after being romantically linked to model and artist Charlotte Rose Smith

The stage and screen star, 39, has reportedly split from Charlotte after they got together in November 2024
At the time, an insider told The Sun: 'They have been enjoying dates and seem very happy together.
'It has been a year since his relationship with Imogen ended and he appears to get on so well with Charlotte. They make a lovely couple.'
While it appears he now back on the dating scene, the model has been busy posting cryptic videos on TikTok. 
'When everything is falling apart I will always have art. Broken heart? Still got my art,' she captioned a recent video of herself working in her London studio. 
In another video, she is strutting around in a chic figure-hugging dress with the caption: 'How I imagine every ex thinks of me.' 
James is not short of support as he moves on from the British beauty. 
He revealed in a recent podcast episode of Travel Secrets that he was planning a Kenya trip soon with his parents, Hugh and Lavinia, and sister Jessica. 
'It's with my family, which is really lovely,' he said. 'There's a point you get to in your early twenties... I was lucky enough to look at my mum and dad when we were all adults, and say, \\"We get on!\\" 

While it appears he now back on the dating scene, the model has been busy posting cryptic videos on TikTok (pictured in a TikTok posted in January) 

James was previously engaged to actress Imogen Poots (pictured in 2022) before their split in 2023

'My dad and I have a grudge match playing chess and we play bridge. 
'My sister has two little boys who are six and four and we have a really nice little family unit. 

 James Norton, 39, 'secretly dating' stunning British model, 25 - a year on from split with ex 
'So for the first time, I'm taking them on holiday. We're going to the Masai Mara for some Safari. I can't wait to see my little nephews do Safari.' 
James was previously engaged to actress Imogen Poots, 35, before they split late 2023. 
They were together for seven years before their demanding careers tore them apart. 
'Some of the choices recently weren't mine, yet I don’t feel begrudging,' James told the Sunday Times late last year. 
Towards the end of their relationship, he had been starring in A Little Life - a West End adaptation of Hanya Yanagihara’s novel dealing with trauma and abuse - and admitted he had 'given his life' to the demanding role. 
'If the work starts to compromise one's relationships, it can become unhealthy,' he reflected. 
'Suddenly you realise you haven’t left any space for other people and so I was p***ed off with that.'
