Baku, May 28 (QNA) - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that his country is determined to continue to defend the rights of the babies and the innocent people killed in the Gaza Strip and to stand in the way of attempts to destabilize the region.

This came during his participation in a trilateral summit in Azerbaijan on Wednesday with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in which Erdogan stressed that solidarity and joint action among their three countries is a necessity given regional developments.

The Turkish President called on the international community to exert pressure on Israel to establish a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and ensure the delivery of urgent humanitarian aid.

Erdogan pointed out that all three countries will jointly contribute to projects such as the Turkiye-Azerbaijan-Pakistan Development Road, the Middle Corridor, and the North-South Transport Corridor.

In turn, the Azerbaijani President said that all three countries have always stood and continue to stand in support of sovereignty, territorial integrity, and justice.

Aliyev highlighted their countries' trilateral defense partnership, including joint military exercises and military-technical projects, which have strengthened the capabilities of Azerbaijan's armed forces, adding that this military cooperation enhances peace and stability across a wide geographical area.

President Aliyev also said that his country and Turkiye play an important role in ensuring energy security, adding that both countries have launched major renewable energy production and export projects. (QNA)
