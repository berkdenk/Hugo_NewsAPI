By The Associated Press

Israel launched a wave of strikes across Iran on Friday that targeted its nuclear program and military sites, killing at least two top military officers and raising the prospect of an all-out war between the two bitter Middle East adversaries. 

It appeared to be the most significant attack Iran has faced since its 1980s war with Iraq.

Iran quickly retaliated, sending a swarm of drones at Israel as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned of “severe punishment.”

The attack comes as tensions reached new heights over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program. The Board of Governors at the International Atomic Energy Agency for the first time in 20 years on Thursday censured Iran over it not working with its inspectors. Iran immediately announced it would establish a third enrichment site in the country and swap out some centrifuges for more advanced ones.

Israeli leaders cast the attack as necessary to head off an imminent threat that Iran would build nuclear bombs, though it remains unclear how close the country is to achieving that.

Here’s the latest:

Israeli military said it hit ‘underground command center’

The Israeli military said military jets hit a site where Revolutionary Guard officials had “assembled in an underground command center,” allegedly “to prepare for an attack on the state of Israel,” and killed Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh along with two other senior officials.

It did not offer details or information to support the claim.

“Hajizadeh publicly declared his commitment to Israel’s destruction at various events in recent years and played a central role in developing the Iranian regime’s plan for Israel’s destruction,” the Israelis said.

It also linked those killed to an attack on Saudi Arabia in 2019.

Israel claims it killed head of Revolutionary Guard missile program

Israel claimed Friday it killed Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the Revolutionary Guard’s missile program in Iran.

Iran did not immediately acknowledge his death officially, though rumors of his death had been circulating for some time online.

Hajizadeh is a major commander within the Guard, overseeing its ballistic missile arsenal.

Museums in Iran close after attacks

Museums in Iran are taking the extraordinary step of closing down until further notice after attacks by Israel, and were transferring valuable items to secure vaults, officials announced Friday.

The state-affiliated Borna news agency reported the order by Ali Darabi, Iran’s deputy minister and cultural heritage chief.

Such moves have been done only in extraordinary circumstances in Iran, including the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and the coronavirus outbreak.

Trump urges Iran to reach nuclear deal with Washington

U.S. President Donald Trump is again urging Iran to reach a deal with Washington on its nuclear program, warning that Israel’s attacks “will only get worse.”

In his first public comments since the Friday attacks, Trump said on his Truth Social platform that “there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end.”

Hezbollah says Israel has ‘crossed all red lines’

The Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has accused the U.S. of providing “approval, coordination, and direct cover-up” for Israel’s strikes, adding that Israel “has crossed all red lines, believing that by doing so, it will change the equations.”

In a statement, the group issued condolences to Tehran for the leaders who were killed, but did not threaten to join in the retaliation.

Jordan says strikes push region into more tension

Jordan’s state media says the country’s foreign minister has discussed Israel’s strikes on Iran with his Egyptian counterpart, and warned that the attack pushes the region into more tension and conflict.

Jordan News Agency said the ministers called the strikes a “dangerous escalation and a flagrant violation of international law.”

The ministers also said Israel’s attacks on the Gaza Strip should stop to and a two-state solution is needed to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East.

Egypt and Jordan are among Arab countries that signed peace treaties with Israel and have normal relations with it.

EU’s top diplomat calls for de-escalation in the Middle East

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called the fresh outbreak of violence in the Middle East “deeply alarming.”

“Europe urges all parties to exercise maximum restraint, de-escalate immediately and refrain from retaliation. A diplomatic resolution is now more urgent than ever, for the sake of the region’s stability and global security,” she said in a post on the Bluesky social media platform.

Iran names replacements for commanders killed in strikes

Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has replaced two top military commanders killed in a wave of Israeli strikes on Friday.

State TV said he tapped Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi as the new head of the armed forces, replacing Gen. Mohammad Bagheri. Mousavi was previously the top army commander.

Khamenei chose Mohammad Pakpour to lead the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, replacing Gen. Hossein Salami.

Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, created after its 1979 Islamic Revolution, is one of the main power centers within the country’s theocracy.

Israeli officials say they smuggled weapons into Iran ahead of strikes

Israeli security officials say the country’s Mossad spy agency smuggled weapons into Iran ahead of Friday’s strikes that were used to target its defenses from within.

Two security officials spoke on condition of anonymity on Friday to discuss the highly secretive missions. It was not possible to independently confirm their claims. There was no official comment.

The officials said a base for launching explosive drones was established inside Iran and that the drones were activated during Friday’s attack to target missile launchers at an Iranian base near Tehran.

They said Israel had also smuggled precision weapons into central Iran and positioned them near surface-to-air missile systems. They said it also deployed strike systems on vehicles. Both were activated as the strikes began, in order to target Iran’s defenses, the officials said.

Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem is closed to the public

With gates to the Al-Aqsa mosque closed by Israeli police, only the guards and employees of the holy site will be present for traditional Friday prayers, the site’s custodian said Friday.

The mosque is the third holiest site for Muslims, and is located on the holiest site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount.

The Waqf, the Islamic endowment which administers the site, said Israel has banned public gatherings. The call to prayer will sound as usual.

Iraq calls on UN Security Council to ‘deter this aggression’

The Iraqi government in a statement called Israel’s attacks on neighboring Iran “a flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations” and a “threat to international peace and security, especially as it occurred during the period of US-Iranian negotiations.”

It called for the UN Security Council to convene immediately to take “decisive and concrete measures to deter this aggression, ensure its non-recurrence, and restore the prestige of the international legal system.”

Baghdad, which has close ties with both the U.S. and Iran, has attempted to maintain a difficult balancing act between the two.

Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization said in a statement that parts of the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility were damaged during the Israeli strikes but that no nuclear radiation or chemical contamination has occurred.

NATO chief calls on US, other Israeli allies to press for de-escalation

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte called on Israel’s Western backers to press for an end to the strikes.

“This was a unilateral action by Israel. So I think it is crucial for many allies, including the United States, to work as we speak to de-escalate,” Rutte told reporters in Stockholm after talks with Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson.

Asked whether a nuclear clash might be imminent in the region, Rutte said: “No, we are not close.”

Israel’s defense minister threatens further attacks against Iran

In a statement soon after Israel’s military said it had completed the attack on Iran, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the military would “continue its activities to thwart the Iranian nuclear program and remove threats on the State of Israel.

“The precise hit on the heads of the commanders of the Revolutionary Guards, the Iranian army and the nuclear scientists, who were all involved in promoting the plan to destroy Israel, is a strong and clear message — those who work to destroy Israel will be eliminated.”

Australia and New Zealand condemn strikes

Australia and New Zealand’s governments condemned the Israeli strikes on Friday. 

Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said she was “alarmed by the escalation” between Israel and Iran, which she said risked further destabilizing an already volatile region.

New Zealand’s Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said the strikes were “a huge concern” for his government and “potentially catastrophic” for the Middle East. “The risk of miscalculation is high,” he said.

The two countries were among five that enacted travel and financial sanctions on two far-right Israeli government ministers Wednesday, accusing them of “inciting extremist violence” against Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the Israeli strike “a reckless escalation that risks igniting regional violence.”

“These strikes threaten not only the lives of innocent civilians but the stability of the entire Middle East and the safety of American citizens and forces,” he said. Reed added: “I urge both nations to show immediate restraint, and I call on President Trump and our international partners to press for diplomatic de-escalation before this crisis spirals further out of control.”

Dozens of commercial flights over Iran as attack begins

Dozens of commercial airliners were in Iranian airspace as the strikes took place, according to flight tracking websites.

More than an hour after the Israeli attack, some were still making their way out of Iranian airspace, but some abruptly altered course to more quickly exit the area.

Many nations’ jets already did not overfly Iran because of regional tensions.

Scope of attack remains unclear

The extent of Israel’s strikes remained unclear early Friday.

Explosions could be heard across Tehran, Iran’s capital city. There were some images circulating of damaged residential buildings. 

Iranian state television also was being careful in how they described the assault, suggesting that some areas outside of Tehran that had also been hit.

Netanyahu says strikes respond to threat to Israel’s survival

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an address on YouTube that the country launched “a targeted military operation roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival.” 

He added that the attacks will continue “for as many days at it takes to remove this threat.”

In a statement, he said: “Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region. Israel advised us that they believe this action was necessary for its self-defense. President Trump and the Administration have taken all necessary steps to protect our forces and remain in close contact with our regional partners. Let me be clear: Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.”

Israeli official says Air Force is targeting nuclear and military sites

An Israeli military official says that his country targeted Iranian nuclear and military sites, without identifying them.

The official spoke to journalists on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing operation.

 The Israeli official said Iran poses three threats to state of Israel: First, he alleged that the Iranian government is advancing a “secret program” to develop nuclear weapons. The U.S. intelligence community assesses that Iran is not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon.

Second, the Israeli official said, Iran has thousands of ballistic missiles. Finally, he said Iran has been distributing weapons and arms to proxy groups across the region like Hezbollah and Hamas.

Trump on White House lawn as explosions begin

As the explosions in Tehran started, President Donald Trump was on the lawn of the White House mingling with members of Congress. It was unclear if he had been informed but the president continued shaking hands and posing for pictures for several minutes.

Earlier in the day, Trump said an Israeli attack over Iran’s nuclear program was not imminent “but it looks like it’s something that could very well happen.”

The U.S. has been preparing for something to happen, pulling some diplomats from Iraq’s capital and offering voluntary evacuations for the families of U.S. troops in the wider Middle East.

The White House did not have an immediate comment Thursday night.
