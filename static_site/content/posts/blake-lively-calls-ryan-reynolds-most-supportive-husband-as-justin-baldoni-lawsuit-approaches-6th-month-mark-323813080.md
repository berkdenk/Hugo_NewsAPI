Blake Lively is moving forward in spite of the ongoing drama with her It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni.
The A Simple Favor star, 37, launched a trio of hair and body scents from her beauty line Blake Brown that her husband, Ryan Reynolds, 48, loves.
'He legitimately uses [the products],' she wrote via Instagram. 'His favorite is the Wild Nectar. 
'I thought he was just being the best and most supportive husband, but he genuinely loves to wear them,' she said.
And it doesn't hurt that the hair and body mists smell 'so yummy and sexy' on him.
Blake also debuted two other mists: Bergamot Woods, and Sandalwood Vanille.
This comes as her lawsuit with Justin Baldoni heads towards its six month anniversary; she first filed on December 31, 2024 

Blake Lively is moving forward in spite of the ongoing drama with her It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni. Seen here on May 18, 2025 in New York City

'His skin picks up the more woody and masculine notes, with the lighter sweetness falling in the background, creating an overall smoothness,' Lively continued, noting that the scent goes well his cologne.
'It's amazing how versatile fragrance can be and how it adapts to the wearer for any age and gender,' Lively continued. 

 Ryan Reynolds pimps Blake Lively's HAIR CARE range as shock claims emerge about lifestyle company 
'Smelling so differently on him than me and different on us than our mom or our teenage family members.'
The three news mists — Wild Nectar Santal, Bergamot Woods and Sandalwood Vanille — retail from $23 to $26 on Target. 
And the fact that the scents turned out so well is a bonus as they were never planned to be a part of Blake Brown so early.
'This was a response to our community going, \\"Please make fragrance,”' the Another Simple Favor actress told People.
'We never planned to do hair and body fragrances,' Blake added.
Blake's beauty brand launched a year ago to great fanfare and sales. And then, six months later it was eclipsed by the drama and dueling lawsuits between her and Baldoni. 
Blake announced the launch on Monday, writing on her Instagram, 'Blake Brown Beauty just launched Hair & Body Mist. Not because it was our original plan. But because of YOU.'

The A Simple Favor star, 37, launched a trio of hair and body scents from her beauty line Blake Brown that her husband, Ryan Reynolds, 48, loves

'He legitimately uses [the products],' she wrote via Instagram. 'His favorite is the Wild Nectar. 'I thought he was just being the best and most supportive husband, but he genuinely loves to wear them,' she said

And it doesn't hurt that the hair and body mists smell 'so yummy and sexy' on him. Blake also debuted two other mists: Bergamot Woods, and Sandalwood Vanille

'His skin picks up the more woody and masculine notes, with the lighter sweetness falling in the background, creating an overall smoothness,' Lively continued, noting that the scent goes well his cologne
'Because our community embraced our scents with such enthusiasm, support and passion. You asked for a standalone fragrance. We listened. ✨✨'
She went on, 'As overly romantic as it sounds, to me scent has always been a means of transportation. It can bring you back to a place, time, or person. It can offer a momentary escape, or boost of joy and vibrance when you're not feeling your best.'
'Whether it's the smell of your mom cooking your favorite meal from childhood, or the scent of your most beloved person — fragrance is emotional, distinct, it holds stories and memories that have happened and ones yet to come.'
'The significance of scent in all our stories is why we @blakebrownbeauty put so much care into the nuanced and stunning fragrances in our hair products. We planned to stop there.'
She continued: 'But are so grateful to you for authoring our new favorite product - our Hair & Body Mists. Now a staple in all our (and our family's) purses and backpacks. So cheers to you.'
'We hope you enjoy as much as we do. We hope you layer them up and make them your own. But mostly, we hope they bring you joy and memories. I know, cringe, but we mean it. ♥️'
Lively launched her haircare brand in July 2024 to create 'clean formulas with incredible performance at a mass price point with a fragrance that I would spray on my body.'
In a recent interview with People, Lively also shared what her plans are now that she has had a busy spring. 'Just some time off sounds so nice with my babies and my husband,' she said.

'It's amazing how versatile fragrance can be and how it adapts to the wearer for any age and gender,' Lively continued

The new launch comes amid her ongoing legal battle with Baldoni.
It began after she filed a lawsuit against him in December, accusing him of sexual harassment and creating a 'hostile work environment on set.'
Justin retaliated with his own $400 million filing against the actress, along with her husband, with the brutal melee now scheduled for a trial on March 29, 2026. All parties have denied the claims.
Meanwhile Ryan's ex-wife Scarlett Johansson recently broke her silence on the legal drama.
Baldoni's production company Wayfarer Studios is co-financing Scarlett's directorial debut Eleanor The Great.
