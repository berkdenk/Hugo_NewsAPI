Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan could not let go of his French counterpart's finger on Friday as the world leaders met at the European Political Community summit in Albania. 

The awkward interaction between Emmanuel Macron and Erdogan was caught on camera, showing the politicians greeting each other with a handshake. 

Erdogan, who is sat on a chair while Macron stands by his side, is shown grabbing onto the French president's hand and shaking it. 

In an unexpected gesture, the Turkish leader then tightly grips onto Macron's middle finger for a few seconds before releasing the French politician from his grasp. 

The hilarious moment went viral on social media over the weekend, prompting a bag of mixed reactions among internet users. 

Many found humour in the exchange, with one X user joking: 'Hey Erdogan, pull my finger!'. 

'Erdogan has a finger-point recognition palm,' another commented. 

Other internet sleuths interpreted the interaction as an attempt from the Turkish president to assert dominance over Macron. 

'Erdogan shows Macron who's boss,' one X account wrote in response to the video. 

'Macron tried to establish psychological superiority by putting his hand on President Erdogan 's shoulder, but Erdogan wasn't having it. 

'He held Macron's finger tightly and did not let go. Macron has been shown who's the boss,' another user said. 

Others, however, found the Turkish leader's gesture strange, raising questions over Erdogan's health. 

'Erdogan appeared visibly unwell as he held Macron's finger, a gesture that raised concerns—even his wife looked worried' one X account commented. 

'While some may interpret it as a show of dominance, it more likely revealed his frail and ill condition,' the user added. 

It comes as European leaders descended on the Albanian capital of Tirana Friday, as they agreed to press ahead with joint action against Russia over the failure to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine. 

The summit also came as Russia and Ukraine held their first direct peace talks since the early weeks of Moscow's full-scale invasion, which began on February 24, 2022. 

The peace talks, which were held in Turkey Friday, ended after less than two hours, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry. 

French President Emmanuel Macron said it was 'unacceptable that, for a second time, Russia hasn't responded to the demands made by the Americans, supported by Ukraine and the Europeans. 

'No ceasefire, and therefore no meeting at a decision-making level. And no response.'

Macron added: 'We will continue to coordinate with our European partners — the coalition of the willing — and the United States. There will be new contacts and feedback in the coming hours.'

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said: 'The diplomatic efforts that we have made so far have unfortunately failed because of Russia's lack of readiness to take the first steps in the right direction now.'

'But we will not give up; we will continue and we will coordinate well on the European side, together with the Americans,' Merz said.

Prior to the talks, Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that he was committed to ending the war, but urged the European leaders to ramp up sanctions if Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to play for time in talks aimed at securing a truce.

'Ukraine is ready to take all realistic steps to end this war,' Zelensky said. But he warned: 'If it turns out that the Russian delegation really is just theatrical and can't deliver any results today, the world must respond.'

That reaction, he said, should include 'sanctions against Russia's energy sector and banks.
