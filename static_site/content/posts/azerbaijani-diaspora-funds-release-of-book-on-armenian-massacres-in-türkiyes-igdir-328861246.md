BAKU, Azerbaijan, June 6. The book \\"Armenian
Massacre in Igdir through the Eyes of Witnesses\\" by Ziya Zakir
Acar, head of the Association for the Survival and Support of the
Igdir-Azerbaijani Language, History and Culture Community and the
Igdir Azerbaijani House, has been published in Türkiye, the
Azerbaijani State Committee on Work with Diaspora said, Trend reports.

The author of the foreword to the book, published with the
committee's financial support, is its first deputy chairman Valeh

The book, intended for a wide audience in Turkish and English,
tells about the terrible massacres committed by Armenia in Igdir
and surrounding cities through the words of witnesses.

It provides extensive information about the subsequent fate of
Azerbaijanis who were forcibly expelled from Western Azerbaijan and
settled in Igdir in particular.

The facts of genocide were confirmed by the mass graves and
eyewitness accounts discovered with the participation of the
Turkish media in the towns and villages of Igdir province - Oba,
Tuzluca, Hakmehmet, Kulluk, Dize, Arapkiri and Gedikli.

It was noted that dozens of mass graves were also discovered in
other settlements during the excavations.

The publication proved with facts that present-day Armenia is an
ancient Turkish homeland and that the toponyms of Western
Azerbaijan were falsified by Armenia.
