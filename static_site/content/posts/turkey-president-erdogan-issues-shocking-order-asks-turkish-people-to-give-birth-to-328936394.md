After the “Boycott Turkey” campaign Erdogan is now grappling with a new crisis. The population of Turkey is consistently decreasing and the Turkish womens low birth rate has emerged as a huge concern for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Declining birth rates are now being perceived as a threat larger than war. To address this the Turkish government has launched several measures to promote childbirth and has announced 2025 as the Year of the Family.
Last month Erdogan stated that the Decade of Family would be starting in 2026. However his appeal for women to have at least three children and the financial incentives offered to newlyweds may not be enough as Turkey continues to struggle with a deepening economic crisis.
According to the AFP report Official statistics indicate that Turkeys birth rate has dropped from 2.38 children per woman in 2001 to 1.48 in 2025 which is actually below that of France the UK or the US. Erdogan a 71-year-old Islamist president and father of four himself has described this drop as a disaster.
Over his 22-year period of office as Prime Minister and subsequently President of the nation of 85 million Erdogan has seen the fertility rate fall sharply. He has attributed this to women as well as the LGBTQ community.
According to the AFP report President Erdogan has blamed both women and LGBTQ perverts. Retired academic and feminist activist Berrin Sönmez was quoted as saying by AFPWomen and LGBTQ individuals are considered the only culprits for the declining population growth rate with no acknowledgement of political mistakes.
Furthermore she stated People might be hesitant to have children in this chaotic and uncertain environment. Additionally child support is almost non-existent and education has become the most expensive sector.
