Scientific Study
Field: Political Science / History / International Law
This study examines the Yugoslav state’s efforts to ethnically cleanse Muslim Albanians during the interwar period and after World War II. Focusing on Vaso Čubrilović’s memorandum Iseljavanje Arnauta (“Expulsion of the Albanians,” 1937) and the Yugoslavia–Turkey Agreement (1938), the study argues that ethnic cleansing was not merely nationalist rhetoric but a systematic state policy designed and implemented to alter the ethnic composition of Kosovo and other Albanian regions.</div>
