    <div align="start" class="content"><p>BEIJING, May 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/ &ndash; China&rsquo;s State Council Information Office on Monday released its first white paper on the country&rsquo;s national security in the new era. The white paper systematically elaborates on the theoretical system of China&rsquo;s holistic approach to national security for the first time.</p>
<p>According to the white paper, China&rsquo;s holistic approach to national security is the first major strategic thinking established as the guiding principle for national security efforts since the founding of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. It is an important component of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and represents a major theoretical contribution from contemporary China to the global community.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the white paper presents the GSI as the \&ldquo;World Chapter\&rdquo; of China&rsquo;s holistic approach to national security. The white paper notes that the GSI highlights the security vision of building a community with a shared future for humanity, and brings a global outlook to the holistic approach to national security.</p>
<p>With the development and changes of the times, the connotation and extension of national security are constantly expanding, and the international situation is becoming increasingly sharp and complex. In this context, the release of a white paper on national security is of great significance for enhancing the public&rsquo;s understanding of the field and scope of national security, Li Wei, a researcher and security expert at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times.</p>
<p>In the new environment, the white paper can help everyone have a more scientific, comprehensive, and objective understanding and awareness of national security, he said.</p>
<p>Wang Yiwei, a senior research fellow at the Institute of Global and Area Studies, Renmin University of China, echoed Li. He explained that the concept of national security used to include domestic and international security, but the boundary between the two forms of security is getting increasingly blurred given the turmoil and complex international situation, not to mention that emerging challenges in the governance of artificial intelligence and the management of the ecological environment have brought about new problems in the field of security.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s holistic approach to national security stresses the common security of the global society. And this is a vital reason behind why China proposed the GSI: to create a new era of common and sustainable security without hegemony at the institutional level, Wang noted.</p>
<p>Chinese wisdom</p>
<p>In April 2022, President Xi Jinping proposed the GSI at the Boao Forum for Asia, offering Chinese wisdom, solutions, and strength to address global security challenges, bridge the peace deficit, and promote shared security worldwide.</p>
<p>In the GSI concept paper published in 2023, China expounded the initiative&rsquo;s core ideas and principles, reaffirming its commitments to abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously, and peacefully resolving differences and disputes between countries through dialogue and consultation, among other pledges.</p>
<p>By integrating the GSI into China&rsquo;s holistic approach to national security and connecting it with the global community with a shared future, the white paper is providing a specific plan for the construction of the global community with a shared future from the perspective of security, according to Wang.</p>
<p>According to the white paper, the GSI addresses the urgent need of the international community to uphold world peace and prevent conflicts. It echoes the shared aspirations of the vast majority of nations for win-win cooperation over hegemony and bullying, aligning with humanity&rsquo;s common pursuit of lasting peace and universal security. The initiative offers a new pathway to eliminate the root causes of international conflicts, tackle global security challenges, and improve global security governance.</p>
<p>China is not only an active proponent of the GSI, but also a steadfast practitioner.</p>
<p>According to the white paper, as of May 2024, China had sent more than 50,000 peacekeepers to participate in more than 30 UN peacekeeping missions in over 20 countries and regions. The country had also dispatched more than 30,000 medical personnel to 77 countries and regions, benefiting at least 300 million patients.</p>
<p>The country has also played a constructive role in resolving some of the world&rsquo;s most challenging regional conflicts, bringing certainty and positive energy to a world filled with turmoil, according to the white paper. Regarding the Ukraine crisis, China released a paper outlining its position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, actively engaging in shuttle diplomacy and urging peace talks; China facilitated the reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and Iran; under China&rsquo;s efforts, Palestinian factions signed the Beijing Declaration to end division and strengthen Palestinian national unity.</p>
<p>China upholds true multilateralism, promotes adherence to international law, and drives reforms to make the global security governance system fairer, more equitable, and responsive to the will and interests of the majority of countries. This approach better meets practical needs in addressing global challenges, the white paper notes.</p>
<p>Global contribution</p>
<p>Over the past three years, the GSI has served as an important public good contributed by China to global security. It has played a positive role, garnered widespread support, demonstrated significant contemporary relevance and practical impact, and continues to benefit the noble cause of human peace and development.</p>
<p>Along with its implementation, the initiative has also gained recognition, understanding of, and support from many countries, regions, and international organizations around the world.</p>
<p>According to the white paper, by the end of 2024, the GSI had received support and appreciation from 119 countries and international organizations, and had been included in 123 bilateral and multilateral political documents.</p>
<p>Talking about how China and Brazil could cooperate in the field of security, Marina dos Santos, a legislator from Rio de Janeiro, told the Global Times in a recent interview that China&rsquo;s experience in public security offers valuable lessons for Rio de Janeiro, particularly in the state&rsquo;s efficacy in protecting its citizens. \&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just about ensuring personal safety and material property, but about using security to foster well-being and quality of life,\&rdquo; she noted.</p>
<p>The three major global initiatives proposed by China - namely the GDI, the GSI and the GCI - have become important strategic guides for building a community with a shared future. These three initiatives indicate the direction for human society&rsquo;s progress from the dimensions of development, security, and civilization, complementing and reinforcing each other. They serve as a crucial foundation for promoting the construction of a community with a shared future and provide a Chinese solution to significant issues concerning human peace and development, according to Wang.</p>
<p>The three global initiatives demonstrate that China&rsquo;s confidence in global governance is transforming into conscious action, which involves deliberately linking domestic reform and opening up with global governance and actively advancing the modernization of governance systems and capabilities, Wang noted.</p>
<p>Like the interpretation of the GSI in the recent white paper, Wang expects China to take the initiative to provide more specific perspective and plans to practically promote the construction of a global community with a shared future.</p>
