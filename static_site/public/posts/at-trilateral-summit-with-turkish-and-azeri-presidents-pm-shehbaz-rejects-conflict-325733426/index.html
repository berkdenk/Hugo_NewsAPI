        <h2>At trilateral summit with Turkish and Azeri presidents, PM Shehbaz ‘rejects conflict’</h2>

    </div>

    <div align="start" class="content"><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said he, along with the presidents of Turkiye and Azerbaijan, had gathered at a trilateral summit to “reject conflict”.</p>
<p>The prime minister participated in the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit alongside presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ilham Aliyev. The meeting comes as the premier continued his tour to friendly countries to appreciate their support for Pakistan during the recent conflict with India.</p>
<p>Speaking at the summit, PM Shehbaz said: “The world we live in faces numerous grave challenges, including armed conflict, climate change, diseases and economic crises.</p>
<p>“This is why the three of us have assembled here today, opting for compassion while rejecting conflict. We are confident that patience and wisdom will ultimately usher in peace and prosperity.”</p>
<p>Addressing Aliyev, the premier thanked him for the hospitality shown to him and his delegation, noting that today’s summit “reflects the meeting of hearts and souls of genuine friends and sincere well-wishers”.</p>
<p>Recalling the “most fruitful discussions” at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit last year in Kazakhstan, PM Shehbaz said, “We are now eagerly looking forward to taking our trilateral partnership to new heights that would be in consonance with the wishes and desires of our people.</p>
<p>“This would be no surprise to anyone as Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Turkiye are bound together by deep historical, cultural and spiritual ties forged through centuries of shared values and mutual support,” he asserted.</p>
<p>“This historical relationship has been further strengthened as we have stood by each other, whether it be on Karabakh, Kashmir or northern Turkish Cyprus. Our strength lies in our solidarity and mutual respect.”</p>
<p>Noting the “outpouring of love and affection in both Turkiye and Azerbaijan” for Pakistan, PM Shehbaz noted: “We could not but be mesmerised by the intensity of the fervour and enthusiasm of our common citizens during Pakistan’s recent conflict with India.”</p>
<p>He noted that India “not only failed to bring any credible evidence against Pakistan but also rejected our sincere and generous offer of a neutral, transparent investigation into the so-called incident in Pahalgam by any international body”.</p>
<p>At the outset of his speech, the premier congratulated Aliyev and the Azerbaijani nation on their Republic Day. “The way the Azeri nation fought for its liberation, you earned a high position in the community of nations.”</p>
<p>He also felicitated the Turkish president for “very skillfully resolving the issue” of the PKK, referring to the Kurdish rebels’ recent decision to disband. “That goes to explain in volumes, my brother, your diplomatic skills to resolve this issue, and by virtue of this, you have earned a high place and influence not only in the region, but beyond.”</p>
<p>Addressing the summit first, President Aliyev said: “The recent tensions between Pakistan and India had troubled us the most and we watched it very closely in the hope that peace would prevail, and from the early hours we have expressed our solidarity with brotherly Pakistan.</p>
<p>“We would like to see dialogue and negotiations in line with the UN Charter and resolutions; this is the way to move forward in this conflict.”</p>
<p>According to Radio Pakistan, the prime minister will also address a ceremony marking Azerbaijan’s Independence Day later today.</p>
<p>PM Shehbaz arrived in Lachin yesterday on the third leg of his four-nation tour after visiting Turkiye and Iran. He will later depart for Tajikistan, where he will attend the International Conference on Glaciers in Dushanbe.</p>
<p>A day ago, the premier held a bilateral meeting with President Aliyev and thanked him for Azerbaijan’s support during the recent confrontation with India. Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir was also present on the occasion.</p>
<p>The prime minister thanked Azerbaijan for its “steadfast support during the recent Pakistan-India confrontation in the face of Indian provocation”, a press release by the PM’s Office said.</p>
<p>They reaffirmed their shared commitment to diversifying the strategic partnership through investment in mutually beneficial avenues. The Azerbaijan side agreed to the exchange of delegations regarding the progress of Azerbaijan’s investment in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Earlier today, PM Shehbaz extended heartfelt felicitations to President Aliyev and his nation on the “joyous occasion of Azerbaijan’s Independence Day”.</p>
<p>In a post on social media platform X, he said, “Pakistan deeply values its close fraternal bonds with Azerbaijan — rooted in shared history, mutual trust and unwavering support for each other.</p>
<p>“This year, it gives me great pleasure to be able to celebrate this historic day in Azerbaijan, alongside President Aliyev and our Azerbaijani brothers and sisters,” the premier added.</p>
<p>The prime minister expressed confidence that under President Aliyev’s “wise and sagacious leadership, our multi-dimensional partnership will continue to grow from strength to strength”.</p>
