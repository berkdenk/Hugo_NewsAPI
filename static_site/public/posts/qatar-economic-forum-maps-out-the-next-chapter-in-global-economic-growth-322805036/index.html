    </div>

    <div align="start" class="content"><p>Doha, May 19 (QNA) - Under the theme &lsquo;The Road to 2030: Transforming the Global Economy,&rsquo; the fifth edition of the Qatar Economic Forum, Powered by Bloomberg, will kick off Tuesday in Doha in collaboration with Media City Qatar.</p>
<p>The Forum will take place from May 20-22 and will bring together a distinguished group of global leaders and influential CEOs to discuss key issues that are reshaping the global economic landscape.</p>
<p>This year, the Forum will focus on the profound shifts in global capital flows, especially in light of the Gulf region emerging as a major hub for financial power and foreign direct investment, supported by reforms that enhance the business environment, as well as the growing role of Gulf sovereign wealth funds as influential global financiers.</p>
<p>The new edition of the Forum comes at a time when the world is witnessing an unprecedented transformation in the flow of global capital. The Gulf’s role is no longer limited to being a major energy supplier; it has become one of the most influential financial centers worldwide. Gulf sovereign wealth funds are now leading the global financial scene, while bold economic reforms have positioned the region as a top destination for foreign direct investment.</p>
<p>With the Forum taking place in 2025, marking the final stage toward achieving the 2030 visions of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, and Bahrain, the Qatar Economic Forum this year will focus on the strategic decisions being made in the Gulf and their role in shaping global economic trends.</p>
<p>Amid shifting geopolitical alliances and ongoing economic uncertainty, the Forum will explore the next phase of regional transformations and their implications for global markets.</p>
<p>The Forum will center around five key themes that reflect the most pressing global and regional economic challenges: geopolitics, globalization and trade, energy security, technological developments, business and investment outlook, and sports and entertainment. These key themes ensure that discussions align with the most relevant and current economic topics on both global and regional levels.</p>
<p>The Forum will host a series of sessions covering a wide range of topics and featuring various personalities, under titles such as: Global Energy Supplies &amp; Security, The World Adapts to Radical Change, The Geoeconomics of Growth: Finance &amp; Economy Minister Outlook, Fueling the Future: Private Capital in the Middle East, Financial Markets: Balancing Risk &amp; Reward, The Next R&amp;D Hub: Investing in Innovation’s Future, Globalization &amp; Trade: The New Reality, Accelerating Africa: Navigating Disruption, Driving Future Growth, Global Aviation: The Power of Partnerships, Banking 2025: The New Growth Playbook, Economic Diversification : The New Growth Opportunities, The Future of FDI &amp; Shifting Supply Chains, Geopolitics &amp; Economics in The Middle East: A 2025 Forecast, Crypto Investor Outlook, Striking the Balance: Crypto &amp; Regulation, The Regional Media Production Industry, Cross-Border Collaboration, Rethinking Economic Impact and Development in the AI Era, Hunting for Growth, Investing in America, Multi-Team, Multi-Sport &amp; Multi-Media, Powering AI: Confronting Growing Demand, Global Real Estate: Supply &amp; Demand, Navigating Volatile Markets, Doing Global Business in Tumultuous Times, Tourism in Focus, and Crypto &amp; Digital Assets: Investing in the New Era.</p>
<p>The Forum holds great significance for all stakeholders in the global economy and the Middle East region, which is witnessing unprecedented dynamism. It has become a vital platform for advancing economic dialogue and innovation by bringing together global leaders, strategic thinkers, and industry pioneers in Doha to help shape the future.</p>
<p>The fifth edition of the Forum takes place just five years before the realization of Qatar National Vision 2030, making it an ideal platform to discuss future-shaping factors that will impact the local economy, particularly in the areas of trade, investment, and technology. The Forum also serves as a key driver in achieving the goals of Vision 2030 and stands out as one of Qatar’s leading platforms for economic and cultural diplomacy. It attracts some of the world&rsquo;s most prominent leaders and decision-makers to exchange ideas, enhance cross-industry integration, and promote innovation.</p>
<p>The Qatar Economic Forum, Powered by Bloomberg, has grown into more than just a venue for the exchange of ideas, to become a cornerstone of Qatar’s economic and strategic outreach. The most recent edition of the forum generated an estimated QR 75 million in GDP contribution, while creating hundreds of jobs across multiple sectors, underscoring its significant economic impact.</p>
<p>Since its launch in June 2021, the forum has rapidly established itself as an essential annual event for addressing global economic trends, assessing future growth prospects, and confronting emerging challenges with actionable solutions.</p>
<p>The inaugural edition, held virtually under the theme \&ldquo;Reimagining the World,\&rdquo; set the stage for a series of high-impact forums. Subsequent editions addressed critical issues with thought-provoking themes such as \&ldquo;Equalizing Global Economic Recovery\&rdquo; (2022), \&ldquo;A New Global Growth Story\&rdquo; (2023), and \&ldquo;A World Remade: Navigating the Year of Uncertainty\&rdquo; (2024), each reflecting the evolving global landscape.</p>
<p>The forum has played a central role in diagnosing the state of the global economy, forecasting economic trajectories, and shaping long-term strategies for sustainable growth. It has consistently highlighted the key challenges affecting economies and communities worldwide.</p>
<p>Over its four editions, the forum has witnessed a notable evolution in scale and influence. The fourth edition alone attracted over 1,500 global leaders, CEOs, and government officials from 124 countries, and hosted more than 300 bilateral meetings - twice the number recorded the previous year. The 2022 edition featured over 120 renowned speakers, while the 2023 forum welcomed nine heads of state and several high-profile business leaders, further amplifying its role in shaping global economic dialogue.</p>
<p>During the fourth edition, a total of 21 high-value memorandums of understanding (MoUs) were signed, 18 of which were international in scope, reflecting Qatar’s growing appeal as a center for business collaboration and investment.</p>
<p>The Qatar Economic Forum is a key pillar of the nation’s strategy to position itself as a leading global business hub. It offers an international platform where policymakers, business executives, and experts converge to address the most pressing economic challenges and explore innovative, future-ready solutions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the forum acts as a powerful catalyst for promoting Qatar’s economy globally, spotlighting the competitive advantages and incentives the country offers to attract foreign investment and business development. This visibility not only bolsters investor confidence but also helps accelerate economic diversification and growth.</p>
<p>Qatar’s strategic geographic location further enhances its global connectivity. With a 563-kilometer coastline along the western shores of the Arabian Gulf, state-of-the-art infrastructure, advanced road networks, a world-class international airport, and a modern seaport, Qatar serves as a vital gateway between East and West, Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>These advantages have positioned Qatar as a premier destination for global conferences and major international events, with the Qatar Economic Forum standing out as a key initiative that strengthens national visibility, encourages cross-border collaboration, and promotes investment opportunities both at home and abroad.
