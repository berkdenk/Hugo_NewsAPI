        <h2>Boycott Turkey: Online Retailers Ajio, Myntra Suspend Sale Of Turkish Brands</h2>
        <h5></h5>
        

    </div>

    <div align="start" class="content"><p>Indian ecommerce platforms such as Ajio and Myntra have removed Turkish apparel brands from their portals in response boycott calls triggered by Turkey’s support for Pakistan after India’s Operation Sindoor, launched to dismantle terror sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) in aftermath of Pahalgam terror attck.
Myntra has pulled Trendyol, a top-selling women’s fashion label in India, from its listings. Other Turkish brands like Koton, Mavi, and LC Waikiki have also disappeared from both Myntra and Ajio, either marked “out of stock” or removed altogether.
“The visibility of Turkish brands was proactively restricted on Myntra when the tensions started to escalate last weekend and was later suspended completely on Thursday,” one official told Economic Times.
“In solidarity with our fellow citizens, we are actively reassessing our offerings across platforms to ensure they reflect the values and sentiments of the country,” a Reliance spokesperson said.
The boycott movement is gaining rapid traction on social media, with consumers echoing nationalistic calls to “Buy Indian” and avoid Turkish or Azerbaijani products.
Praveen Khandelwal, Lok Sabha MP and National Secretary General of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) commended the move saying that it is a strong step in national interest.
“At a time when Turkey is openly supporting Pakistan and its anti-India agenda, Indian companies taking a firm stand against its economic interests is a true reflection of patriotism and commercial prudence. AJIO and Myntra have exemplified the spirit of ‘Nation First’ through this move,” Khandelwal said.
He emphasised that the time has come for all e-commerce, retail, and FMCG companies in India to act in the same spirit and remove products or brands from Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Pakistan from their supply chains.
CAIT Calls For Boycott
Earlier on Friday, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) has formally urged a boycott of Turkish and Azerbaijani products and services across sectors, from imports and exports to tourism and entertainment.
The association further said that Indian exporters, importers, and business delegations will be discouraged from any engagement with companies or institutions based in Turkey and Azerbaijan.
The traders’ lobby shared that a memorandum will be submitted to the ministry of commerce and industry and the ministry of external affairs, urging policy-level review of all commercial ties with these nations.
“The collective Indian trading community views this as a betrayal, particularly considering the humanitarian and diplomatic support extended to both countries in the past by India and especially by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during their respective crises,” CAIT said in a statement.
Additionally, India has revoked security clearance for Celebi Aviation, a Turkish firm handling 70% of Mumbai airport ground ops, following reports of Turkish drone use by Pakistan. The fallout is spreading fast: travel platforms report a 250% surge in cancellations, Bollywood unions push for bans, and Delhi’s Azadpur mandi halts Turkish apple imports.</p>
