        <h2>Billboard’s 2025 Global Power Players Revealed</h2>
        <h5></h5>
        

    </div>

    <div align="start" class="content"><p>Recorded music is a small but mighty sector” of the world’s business, IFPI CEO Victoria Oakley said as she introduced the organizations’s annual report in March. “It’s a part of the global economy that really matters. Above all, it’s a powerful example of human artistry and connectivity.”</p>
<p>Oakley quantified the impact of that artistry with a report full of good news — mostly. The recorded-music business worldwide grew for the 10th consecutive year, despite concerns raised by generative artificial intelligence (AI) using copyright-protected music to train its systems.</p>
<p>Total recorded-music revenue climbed to $29.6 billion in 2024, a rise of 4.8% on the previous year, with streaming revenue surpassing $20 billion for the first time, representing just under 70% of global recorded-music sales, according to IFPI’s Global Music Report 2025. Similarly, CISAC in October reported that global royalty collections for song rights holders grew 7.6% in the previous year. In the concert industry, Live Nation’s adjusted operating income rose 14% in 2024.</p>
<p>“Today, we celebrate not just these results and these phenomenal artists, but also the amazing hard work that goes into making it happen behind the scenes,” Oakley said.</p>
<p>Those working behind the scenes are celebrated here, on Billboard’s Global Power Players list.</p>
<p>Nominated by their firms and peers and chosen by our editors from selected industry sectors, these executives have primary responsibility for markets outside the United States, which account for some 60% of the world’s recorded-music revenue.</p>
<p>They work where the action is — or at least, the greatest growth. While the United States held its place as the No. 1 recorded-music market in the world, its revenue increased only 2.2% in 2024, compared with 7.2% in 2023.</p>
<p>Japan, still the world’s second-largest recorded&ndash;music market, was flat in 2024. But among the world’s remaining top 10 markets, IFPI reports rates of growth in the United Kingdom (up 4.9%), Germany (up 4.1%), China (up 9.6%), France (up 7.5%), Canada (up 1.5%), Brazil (up 21.7%) and Mexico, the top 10 market where its revenue increased 15.6%. (South Korea was down 5.7%.)</p>
<p>In other regions, recorded-music growth has been even more dramatic. Latin America experienced growth of 22.5%. The Middle East and North Africa, which are almost entirely dominated by streaming, had music sales grow 22.8%, and sub-Saharan Africa recorded a 22.6% rise in revenue to surpass $100 million for the first time, albeit from a modest baseline. Just as the rise of file-sharing dramatically cut the fortunes of the music industry at the turn of the 21st -century, today, executives nervously watch the rise of another technology — generative AI — due to its potential and its threat to copyright. Many of the executives profiled in this list cite AI as the biggest issue facing the industry.</p>
<p>IFPI’s presentation in London took place against the backdrop of a campaign in the United Kingdom to oppose proposed changes by the government to copyright law that, if implemented, could let AI developers freely use creators’ content to train their algorithms, unless rights holders “opt out.”</p>
<p>“We are asking policymakers to protect music and artistry,” Oakley said in a statement accompanying the Global Music Report. “We must harness the potential of AI to support and amplify human creativity, not to replace it.”</p>
<p>Music Groups: Global</p>
<p>Fred GillhamManaging director, U.K. and Europe, Concord Label GroupRebecca BermanSenior vp of international, Concord Label Group, Concord</p>
<p>It’s hard to top the success of breakout star Tommy Richman’s “Million Dollar Baby.” Concord’s Berman says the Billboard Global 200 chart-topping smash that also was a massive hit on TikTok and global radio “was a huge achievement for both Richman and Concord,” after its initial U.S. release through ISO Supremacy and Pulse Music Group. In addition, she says that the continued expansion of Concord’s global marketing network has contributed to the label group’s growing prowess around the world. “We have expertise in every major market in the world,” she says, “dedicated to executing globally minded campaigns to reach fans everywhere and find new audiences.”</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “The changing nature of how audiences consume and how difficult it can be to find your engaged audience. These changes are emphasized further with the globalized nature of the music industry, where platforms, DSPs [digital service providers], etc., may be different from country to country or region to region,” Berman says. “Blanket approaches to international marketing are ineffective.”</p>
<p>Adam GraniteCEO, Africa, the Middle East and AsiaMichelle TehSenior vp of global classics and jazz, Universal Music Group</p>
<p>Granite sees “our growth across Greater China, India, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa through -organic A&amp;R success” as being among the highlights of the past year for UMG. He also cites “the expansion of our distributed label business in partnership with Virgin and our continued merger and acquisition focus.” However, he adds that finding “the appropriate monetization for real engagement” could challenge growth going forward. Granite also spent valuable time over the past year community-building, including visiting Dharavi Dream Project’s After School of Hip-Hop in Mumbai, India, a partnership involving UMG that provides youth outlets for artistic expression utilizing hip-hop culture.</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Exciting,” Granite says.</p>
<p>Celine JoshuaExecutive vp of global marketingJohannes von SchwarzkopfChief strategy officer, BMG</p>
<p>BMG reported in March that it generated 963 million -euros ($1 billion) in revenue in 2024, marking a 6.4% increase over the previous year, with major wins coming from artists like country superstar Jelly Roll and rap hit-maker Mustard. Von Schwarzkopf considers the successful execution of the company’s BMG Next strategy to be a big factor in its recent success: “In the last 12 months, we’ve built global teams in recorded catalog, sales and marketing to better support our artists and songwriters worldwide, while also strengthening our local artist career teams where proximity to the market matters,” he says. “By working collaboratively across borders, our teams are strengthening our international business relationships, improving our service to artists and songwriters and positioning BMG for sustainable growth.”</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Opportunity,” von Schwarzkopf says.</p>
<p>Melissa ThomasExecutive vp of international marketing for U.S. repertoireWouter JansenSenior vp of international marketing, digital and commercial strategyNaoise RyanVp of international marketing, Columbia Records, Sony Music Entertainment</p>
<p>Sony’s international team recently worked on campaigns for Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter; Tyler, The Creator’s Chromakopia; and both Future’s collaborative albums with Metro Boomin, We Don’t Trust You and We Still Don’t Trust You, and solo release Mixtape Pluto. They also marketed multiple singles from SZA’s SOS Deluxe: LANA ahead of her headlining slots at Glastonbury and London’s BST Hyde Park festivals in the United Kingdom. The Sony team also worked on campaigns for Travis Scott, Tyla, PartyNextDoor and Addison Rae, as well as Blackpink stars Lisa and Jennie. Sony Music’s key to success, Thomas says, is that “all of our campaign highlights from the past 12 to 18 months have had one through line: fan strategy.”</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Competitive — in the best way possible,” Thomas says.</p>
<p>Eric WongPresident of EastWest Records/head of global A&amp;RJessica Keeley-CarterChief marketing officerTony CoreySenior vp of global marketingZac FroudVp of global marketing, Warner Music Group</p>
<p>WMG’s global teams have “collaborated to secure standout results across key markets” for its rising stars, according to Keeley-Carter. Blackpink’s Rosé charted in the top 10 in more than 10 countries and has spent 19 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard’s Global Excl. U.S. chart with “APT.” with Bruno Mars. Teddy Swims’ recent album, I’ve Tried Everything but Therapy (Part 2), hit No. 1 on the Australian Recording Industry Association chart; Benson Boone’s single “Sorry I’m Here for Someone Else” reached Spotify charts in 30 different markets; and Alex Warren’s “Ordinary” hit No. 1 on the Official Singles Chart in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Noisy,” Keeley-Carter says. “We’re here to help our artists rise above it and make their mark.”</p>
<p>Music Groups: Canada</p>
<p>Julie AdamPresident/CEO, Universal Music Canada</p>
<p>According to Universal Music Canada, it released the top seven of the 10 best-performing albums of 2024 thanks to Post Malone, Billie Eilish, Sabrina Carpenter, The Weeknd, Morgan Wallen, Noah Kahan and Taylor Swift. “We anchored and supported each project with Canada-specific campaigns, content and fan events,” Adam says. “Our domestically signed acts continue to impact international markets. Rising pop star Sofia Camara is exploding in the U.K., country breakout Josh Ross continues to climb the charts in the U.S. and beyond, comedian turned singer-songwriter Mae Martin released their debut album, Owen Riegling is breaking out with national brand partnerships, and Punjabi super-producer thiarajxtt is driving artist discovery with fans from South Asia to Canada.”</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Artists. All that we do is for, about and in support of artists.”</p>
<p>Kirsten BurkePresident, Warner Music Canada</p>
<p>“One of Warner Music Canada’s biggest success stories this past year was the extension of our partnership with Karan Aujla,” Burke says, noting the extended joint venture between Warner Music Canada and Warner Music India. “As the most streamed Punjabi artist on Spotify worldwide in 2024, Karan’s influence is undeniable,” says Burke, who adds that the Indian rapper is known for constantly evolving and pushing the boundaries of both Punjabi and global music. “We kicked off the year with the release of ‘Tell Me,’ a dynamic Punjabi-English collaboration with OneRepublic. The song quickly charted in Canada, [the United Arab Emirates], Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., Pakistan and India, further underscoring his global appeal.”</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “The impact of AI on creativity, rights management and artist compensation.”</p>
<p>Shane CarterPresident, Sony Music Entertainment Canada</p>
<p>“I am honored to be part of the team who brought Céline Dion’s deeply personal, moving story to the world in the documentary I Am: Céline Dion,” says Carter, who worked as an executive producer alongside teams at Sony Music Canada, Sony Vision and several global partners to bring the film to life. “Everyone involved in this project was so talented and 100% committed to the collaboration required to tell Céline’s story with sensitivity and authenticity. It was a highlight of the year — and also my career.” The journey culminated in Dion’s powerful return to the stage at the opening ceremonies for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “We work alongside artists to build their audience authentically over time. This requires -deeper collaboration across teams and innovative, strategic campaigns that truly connect. It’s a challenge — but also an exciting opportunity to match artists’ creativity with bold new ways to share their music with the world.”</p>
<p>Music Groups: Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa</p>
<p>Frank BriegmannChairman/CEO, Universal Music Central Europe and Deutsche GrammophonOlivier NusseCEO, Universal Music France and Universal Music Africa (French-speaking)Patrick BoulosCEO, Universal Music Group Middle East and North AfricaFranck KacouManaging director, Universal Music Africa</p>
<p>It was a banner year for UMG throughout Africa and Europe, particularly in Germany, where half of the top 10 albums on the year-end 2024 charts belonged to UMG, and the company held six places among the top 10 most streamed music artists. “We are also very proud that we have been able to break six domestic artists,” Briegmann says. Deutsche Grammophon artists were No. 1 on the German classical chart in 10 out of 12 months in the last year. In Italy, UMG landed six of the top 10 albums on the year-end 2024 chart, while UMG albums were No. 1 in the Netherlands for 33 out of 52 weeks. For Nusse, Stromae &amp; Pomme’s “Ma Meilleure Ennemie,” which was featured in the Arcane TV series, became a global success with nearly 470 million streams, “85% of which came from international markets,” he says.</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Artist-centric,” Nusse says.</p>
<p>Tony HarlowCEO, Warner Music U.K.</p>
<p>From his post leading Warner Music in London, Harlow has supported Warner Music Group developments, including the overall reorganization of the company and the restructuring of its leadership in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Both changes “have opened new doors for us,” he says. “The return of Warner Records U.S. and Atlantic Records U.S. as a repertoire powerhouse has hugely helped us,” Harlow says, giving a shoutout to the executives guiding those companies who have helped drive the global success of U.K. artists including Charli xcx and Coldplay.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “Pessimism. If you talk yourself down, guess where you will end up?”</p>
<p>Jason IleyChairman/CEO, Sony Music U.K. and Ireland, Sony Music Entertainment U.K.</p>
<p>Iley and his Sony team are celebrating the success that Myles Smith and Central Cee are having “at a global level,” he says. Cee’s debut album, Can’t Rush Greatness, hit No. 9 on the Billboard 200. Meanwhile, Smith, who signed to RCA on Christmas Eve in 2023, won the BRIT Awards’ Rising Star honor in March, and his track “Stargazing” topped the Alternative Airplay chart. “Beyond chart success,” Iley says, “I’m really pleased to see results from the holistic work we’ve put into strengthening our business,” with a focus on employee wellness and an award&ndash;winning childcare policy. Such initiatives, he adds, “demonstrate the importance of listening — listening to what our artists and people need from us in order to succeed.”</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “AI is a global issue and one that we are at the forefront of in the U.K. We have been working to help the government understand the implications of their proposed copyright reforms [that would] present a serious threat to our artists and their work.”</p>
<p>Daniel LieberbergPresident of continental Europe and Africa, Sony Music EntertainmentChristoph BehmCEO, Sony Music Entertainment Germany, Switzerland and AustriaMarie-Anne RobertManaging director, Sony Music Entertainment FranceSean WatsonManaging director, Sony Music Entertainment Africa</p>
<p>“It’s been a great year, with a series of successes for our local and international artists thanks to the incredibly hardworking teams across Europe and Africa,” says Lieberberg, who oversaw Sony’s growth in Greece and the Czech Republic through acquisitions, including Supraphron, the latter country’s longest-established record label. In Germany, Sony “delivered a global viral feat” thanks to Raffaella Carrà, Jaxomy and Agatino Romero’s collaboration, “Pedro.” Sony also opened the recording complex ONE Studios in Amsterdam. Artist Shiva set records in Italy by earning 100 million streams in a week, and Sony established a presence in Accra, Ghana, thanks to a partnership with Crux Global.</p>
<p>The music industry today in a word: “Culture-driven,” Lieberberg says.</p>
<p>Alistair NorburyPresident of U.K., Europe and Asia-PacificLevy IsabellaManaging director of Benelux and Scandinavia, BMG</p>
<p>BMG enjoyed a variety of European wins in 2024, with top five debuts on the United Kingdom’s Official Albums Chart for bands Soft Play, Travis and The Script, as well as No. 1 bows for British indie-pop band Blossoms and global pop legend Kylie Minogue, whose Tension also topped charts in Scotland and Belgium. Norbury cites the most significant recent developments of BMG delivering its repertoire directly to digital platforms (while moving physical distribution to Universal) and dabbling in related fields like film and literature. “We are fully focused on being a global music publisher and recordings business,” he says.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “Fair compensation for artists and songwriters in relation to streaming platforms,” Norbury says.</p>
<p>Simon RobsonPresident, Europe, the Middle East and Africa recorded music, Warner Music GroupPico CibelliPresident, Warner Music ItalyFabian DrebesDoreen SchimkCo-presidents, Warner Music Central EuropeMark FryPresident, Warner Music NordicsAlain VeillePresident, Warner Music FranceNiels WalboomersPresident of records and publishing, Benelux, Warner Music GroupTemi AdenijiManaging director, Warner Music Africa</p>
<p>Warner Music’s teams in Europe, Africa, Asia and beyond emphasize “cross-cultural collaborations,” Robson says. These include 91 North Records, a joint venture between the label’s India and Canada outposts, which Robson says had “strong success” in breaking rapper AR Paisley, Punjabi hip-hop lyricist Chani Nattan and Punjabi-focused producer Gminxer, all of whom are Canadian. Warner Music India and Warner Music Canada have also been working together with Karan Aujla and recently released “Tell Me” with OneRepublic. WMG also launched an Africa Francophone brand emphasizing French-speaking sub-Saharan African artists. “We also recently incorporated Warner Music U.K. into our EMEA [Europe, Middle East and Africa] structure to help further boost creative collaborations and align our artist campaigns,” he says.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “Recent IFPI figures showed that global industry growth [in key markets] slowed last year,” Robson says. “That means we must be even more focused on innovation, creativity and strategic deal&ndash;making to ensure sustainable growth for the future.”</p>
<p>Dickon StainerChairman/CEO, Universal Music U.K.</p>
<p>“I would like to highlight the incredible work of our U.K. teams, working with our global partners to put great British artistry back at the heart of international culture — in the shape of Lola Young, Sam Fender, The Last Dinner Party and Olivia Dean,” Stainer says, “and to prove the lasting value of our labels to long-term artist career-building and storytelling on a global scale.” Stainer was named to lead Universal Music U.K. in September 2024, following a long career at UMG, most recently as president/CEO of UMG’s global classics and jazz division. He oversees divisions including Island EMI Label Group, Polydor Label Group, Decca Records and the recently formed Audience and Media Division, as well as Abbey Road Studios.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “To be compelling and relevant to audiences who are bombarded with noise and distraction.”</p>
<p>Music Groups: Latin</p>
<p>Alejandro DuquePresident, Warner Music Latin AmericaGuillermo González ArévaloPresident, Warner Music IberiaLeila OliveriaPresident, Warner Music BrazilTomas RodriguezPresident, Warner Music Mexico and Mexican Music</p>
<p>Warner’s regional approach in the last year has focused on new artist development across the board. Argentine artist Yami Safdie’s track “En Otra Vida” charted in over 20 countries; Venezuela’s Elena Rose not only broke out in multiple countries, but her “Caracas en el 2000” became an anthem in her home country; Danny Ocean’s “Imagínate” soared on Spotify’s global charts; and Colombia’s Blessd amassed millions of monthly listeners. Warner also struck deals with Puerto Rico’s CLARENT, Dominican provocateur Tokisha and partnerships with label Street Mob Records that include rising regional Mexican artists like Armenta, Clave Especial and Calle 24. Warner Music Brazil opened a new headquarters and a creative hub in Rio de Janeiro, together with Warner Chappell Music Brazil and ADA Brazil. “We’ve continued to prove ourselves an instrumental force in developing the voices that are shaping the future of Latin music,” Duque says.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “Music is still extremely undervalued compared with other forms of entertainment,” Duque says.</p>
<p>Jesús LópezChairman/CEO, Universal Music Latin America &amp; Iberian PeninsulaAlfredo DelgadilloPresident/CEO, Universal Music MexicoManuel PeñaManaging director of Andean, Central America and Caribbean, Universal MusicPaulo LimaPresident, Universal Music BrazilLuis EstradaPresident of Southern Cone, Universal Music Argentina</p>
<p>Universal Music Group’s focus on artist development resulted in back-to-back best new artist wins at the Latin Grammys in 2023 (Joaquina) and 2024 (Ela Taubert). The company’s global approach was also evident in Colombia’s Feid, who landed in the top 10 of Billboard’s year-end 2024 Top Latin Artists chart, while Karol G’s 2023 set, Mañana Será Bonito, was the fourth most streamed album globally on Spotify in 2024. Another Colombian, Morat, wrapped a 24-date stadium tour; in Brazil, UMG’s artists included chart-toppers Felipe e Rodrigo, Lauana Prado and Henriquez &amp; Juliano; and in Spain, Lola Índigo was Spotify’s top female artist for 2024.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “Keeping the artist-centric model to protect the rights of artists, composers and music workers, as well as fair reward for real artists and real music,” López says.</p>
<p>Afo VerdeChairman/CEOMaria FernándezExecutive vp/COO, Sony Music Latin-IberiaFernando CabralCEO/executive vp of ticketing operations, Latin America, Sony Music Entertainment BrazilJuan Alfonso SanchezSenior vp/CFO, Sony Music Latin-IberiaJose Maria BarbatPresident, Sony Music IberiaMelissa ExpositoPresident, Sony Music Latin, Central America and CaribbeanRoberto LópezPresident, Sony Music Mexico</p>
<p>Sony had a phenomenal year in Latin music. After leading the Top Latin Albums chart with Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, Shakira’s tour of the same name also made history by ruling Billboard Boxscore’s Top Tours ranking for February (the first for a solo female Latin artist), repeated the feat for March and sold out a record number of stadiums in Mexico City. Rauw Alejandro debuted at No. 1 on the Top Latin Albums chart and No. 6 on the Billboard 200 with Cosa Nuestra, and newcomers Ca7riel y Paco Amoroso’s NPR Tiny Desk performance was the most successful of 2024, with over 30 million YouTube views. Other newcomers who crossed the threshold toward stardom include Colombia’s Kapo, Mexico’s Oscar Maydón and Argentina’s Emilia.</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Un lindo quilombo [A nice mess],” Verde says.</p>
<p>Music Groups: Australasia</p>
<p>Andrew ChanManaging director, Greater China, Sony Music EntertainmentVanessa PickenChair/CEO, Sony Music Australia and New ZealandShridhar SubramaniamPresident of corporate strategy and market development in Asia and the Middle East, Sony Music EntertainmentVinit ThakkarManaging director, India, Sony Music Entertainment</p>
<p>Sony Music’s operations in Australasia scored several big wins in the past 18 months. It acquired DRM New Zealand for The Orchard. The Australia-New Zealand division of the merchandising company Ceremony of Roses expanded operations in the Asia Pacific region and is now working with over 30 international tours. The company created Sony Music Masterworks Australia and New Zealand, a live-music and experiential division of SME that successfully staged Lightscape, Dark Spectrum and Jurassic World Exhibition, as well as a sold-out film/orchestral performance of Avatar: The Last Airbender. Sony also signed Angus &amp; Julia Stone, Gang of Youths and Sydney electronic trio Mansionair.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “To thrive in today’s diverse and decentralized music landscape,” Picken says, “artists and companies must adapt, embrace emerging technologies and build stronger, more direct connections with their audiences.”</p>
<p>Chris GobalakrishnaCOO, Warner Music Asia; CFO, Asia Pacific, recorded music, Warner Music/Recorded MusicDan RosenPresident of records and publishing, Australasia, Warner Music Group/Recorded Music and PublishingJay MehtaManaging director, Warner Music India and South Asian Association for Regional CooperationBrayden CrossleySenior vp of marketing, Warner Music Asia, Warner Music/Recorded Music</p>
<p>“Warner Music Australasia lives by its goal,” Rosen says, “to take our local artists global and make our global artists local.” Among the success stories are New Zealand band Balu Brigada, which hit No. 1 on the Alternative Airplay chart in the United States with its track “So Cold” and is touring the world with Twenty One Pilots. Recent Australian signing Esha Tewari is already selling out shows for her first U.S. solo tour, and Oliver Cronin has had many of his tracks go viral across the world, including in India, the Philippines and Germany. Australia and New Zealand are also breakout markets for Teddy Swims, Benson Boone, Maisie Peters and Charli xcx, according to Rosen.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “As an industry,” Rosen says, “we need to harness the benefits of technology and minimize the potential harms to ensure value is returned to our artists, songwriters and rights holders.”</p>
<p>Matt GudinskiCEO, Mushroom Group</p>
<p>As costs rise across the music ecosystem, creating new business challenges, Mushroom Group keeps evolving. Led by Gudinski, the Melbourne, Australia, independent music company saw one of its “most significant achievements” in 2024 by consolidating its rights companies under the Mushroom Music banner, including recording, publishing and neighboring rights activities. “Additionally, we’ve experienced substantial international growth across the Mushroom Group,” Gudinski says, “reinforcing our position as a dynamic, forward-thinking company that continues to evolve alongside the ever-changing music industry.”</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Competitive, but it’s an exciting time as we enter a new generation where more people than ever are immersed in music.”</p>
<p>Katsumi KuroiwaCEO, AvexBrandon SilversteinCEO, Avex Music Group</p>
<p>The biggest story at Avex this year was the launch of Avex Music Group, a U.S.-based entity led by S10 Entertainment CEO Silverstein that will focus on expanding the global reach of Avex artists and building the company’s publishing portfolio, among other endeavors. That deal includes Avex’s acquisition of S10 Music Publishing’s song catalog and an additional stake in S10 Management. Meanwhile, Avex boy band One or Eight reached No. 1 on Billboard Japan’s Heatseekers Songs chart with “Don’t Tell Nobody,” while producer-writer Grant contributed to eight tracks on Tate McRae’s 2025 Billboard 200 chart-topper, So Close to What.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “As the business environment surrounding artists continues to evolve in the global market, it is increasingly important to invest across a wide range of areas,” Kuroiwa says. “In order to do so, having strong local partner companies is essential.”</p>
<p>Cussion PangExecutive chairmanRoss LiangCEO, Tencent Music Entertainment</p>
<p>“Our company’s music content ecosystem continues to gain vitality,” Pang says. In 2024, TME expanded beyond licensing into music events and artist merchandise. The company also launched three offline events: Tencent Music Entertainment Awards, WaveMusic Awards and QQ Music Super Live. Enhancements to its platforms — QQ Music, Kugou Music and Kuwo Music — helped TME’s subscribers grow 13.4% to 121 million, including more than 10 million Super VIP subscribers. “Our dual&ndash;engine content-and-platform strategy [creates] a virtuous cycle of growth,” Liang adds. (TME is a Billboard licensee in China.)</p>
<p>Timothy XuChairman/CEO, Universal Music Greater ChinaCalvin WongCEO, Universal Music Southeast Asia; senior vp of Asia, Universal Music GroupDevraj SanyalChairman/CEO, Universal Music India and South Asia; senior vp of strategy, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, Universal Music GroupNaoshi FujikuraPresident/CEO, Universal Music JapanSean WarnerPresident, Universal Music Australia and New Zealand</p>
<p>Growth, the expansion of local content and blossoming partnerships are some of the high points of Universal Music’s operations in Asia and Australasia over the past 18 months. Universal Music Japan reported 11 consecutive years of revenue growth. The China business nurtured partnerships with artists such as Jay Chou (the only Chinese-language artist ever to reach No. 1 on IFPI’s Global Albums chart). The India company achieved a global hit with “Big Dawgs” from Hanumankind and Kalmi, and the Australasian affiliate is undergoing changes as well — part of a mission to break artists on a global stage.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “One of our biggest challenges in Japan is maintaining the market despite the population decline, especially among younger generations,” Fujikura says. “To sustain growth, we need to implement strategies that prevent the market from shrinking. Key efforts include expanding the senior user base, increasing revenue per user and developing overseas markets.”</p>
<p>Streaming</p>
<p>Gitte BendzullaCOONigel HardingVp of artist relationsPedro KurtzDirector of content and operations, Americas, Deezer</p>
<p>Harding says that Deezer remains a pioneer in music streaming; he cites the company’s strides toward fairer remuneration (involving both recording and publishing rights) through Deezer’s Artist Centric Payment System initiative. Deezer is focused on fans, too, with its Deezer Flow wheel that personalizes music recommendations based on users’ tastes and features like the Deezer Shaker and discovery programs including Deezer Next. Plus, it’s offering exclusive live experiences like Purple Door, Listening Sessions and rooftop sessions that provide fans intimate access to artists. “These innovations combine technology, engagement and exclusivity to create deeper connections between fans, music and artists,” Harding says.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “The rise of AI-generated content flooding streaming platforms. To address this, Deezer has developed a tool to tag AI-generated content, improving transparency for users and protecting creators’ rights,” Harding says. “We’ve already discovered that over 10% of the tracks delivered daily to the platform are AI-generated and, to safeguard creators, this content will be excluded from algorithmic recommendations.”</p>
<p>Dan ChalmersDirector of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, YouTube MusicLizzie DicksonHead of music, YouTube U.K.Sandra JimenezHead of music for Latin America and U.S. LatinPaul SmithManaging director, Asia Pacific, YouTube Music</p>
<p>Reaching a new milestone of 125 million subscribers to YouTube Music and Premium, the platform’s ad-free video tier, was a highlight of the past year, Chalmers says. “We added 25 million in the past year alone, outpacing industry trends and reinforcing our role as a major revenue driver for the music business.” As global subscription growth slowed slightly in 2024, YouTube Music, which -accounted for 10.1% of the 818 million subscriptions worldwide, according to MIDiA Research, was the only major subscription service to post accelerated subscriber growth compared with 2023.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “Ensuring that people can turn their artistry into sustainable careers and cut through the clutter,” Chalmers says. “Artists need more than just streams or views; they need a strategy for visibility, engagement and monetization. They need the tools to build deep, lasting connections with fans.”</p>
<p>Paul FirthDirector of global music industryRocío GuerreroHead of music, Latin-IberiaLaura LukanzHead of music, U.K.John MurphyHead of music, Canada, Amazon Music</p>
<p>Building on its success in music streaming, Amazon officially integrated “Audible’s unparalleled catalog of audiobooks” into the app for users in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada before then expanding into Australia, New Zealand and France, Firth says. “This launch really solidifies our position as an all-audio destination for subscribers across music, podcasts and audiobooks and was my highlight of 2024,” he says. The platform is also trying to help artists get discovered. “In order to have a thriving music scene, there needs to be a consistent flow of exciting new artists, and they need the opportunity to find audiences around the world,” he adds. “Both our Breakthrough and Artists To Watch programs are designed to provide this support.”</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Fan-centric,” Firth says.</p>
<p>Georges FornayDeputy CEODan MacktaManaging director of North America and Northern Europe, Qobuz</p>
<p>Paris-based audiophile streaming service Qobuz achieved significant milestones in the past year, Mackta says, “including our expansion into Japan, the launch of the Studio Student plan and Qobuz Connect. With the U.S. now our leading market, Qobuz has solidified its status as a global company. These achievements reflect our commitment to delivering a unique and deep music experience and to strengthen our position as the go-to platform for music lovers and audiophiles worldwide.” In March, Qobuz became the first streaming company to publicly release the per-streaming royalty rate it pays to rate holders. The all-in rate, which covers both recorded music and publishing, works out to $18.73 for every 1,000 streams.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “Building a fair and sustainable streaming model that ensures all artists receive proper compensation and have equal opportunities to reach their audience,” Mackta says.</p>
<p>Matt GralenPresidentSofia IlyasChief community officer, The Beatport Group</p>
<p>One of the most significant achievements at Beatport has been the company’s investment in expanding its infrastructure. “By adding a chief community officer role —my role — and a dedicated team to focus on fostering community within the electronic music space, we are able to support grassroots organizations that champion -diversity, many of which are volunteer-led and often overlooked despite being a crucial part of the music ecosystem,” IIyas says. The latest recipients of Beatport’s Diversity + Parity Fund include Change the Beat, Last Night a DJ Saved My Life, One Off Traks, Other Village People, Saffron and We Are Moving the Needle.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “The industry faces several challenges, but one of the most pressing is how artists navigate their careers in a rapidly changing digital landscape,” Ilyas says. “Many artists today seek more autonomy and direct ways to connect with their fans, but the pressure to constantly engage on social media has become overwhelming.”</p>
<p>Emmy LovellGlobal head of musicAma WaltonSenior vp of content partnerships/deputy general counsel, SoundCloud</p>
<p>SoundCloud has partnered with popular club Hï Ibiza in Spain “for a season-long residency that’ll bring James Hype, Meduza and Hannah Laing to one of the biggest stages in electronic music,” Lovell says. “As Hï Ibiza’s first-ever brand partnership in its 10-year history, this is a massive moment that reinforces SoundCloud as a trailblazing platform where global dance music movements are born.” Additionally, Ascending, the artist development program designed to boost upcoming artists, continues to drive real results, with select artists seeing a 60% or more spike in followers. “Ensuring our platform remains a launchpad for emerging talent is something I care deeply about,” Lovell adds, “and with these milestones, we’re making it clear: SoundCloud is the place where artists can break through the noise.”</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Unpredictable,” Lovell says.</p>
<p>Rachel NewmanGlobal head of editorial and contentAnjali MalhotraGlobal director of classicalJuan PazGlobal head of Latin music business, Apple Music</p>
<p>Apple Music’s global footprint was strengthened by a branding initiative that saw the creation of the Apple Music 100 Best Albums and by the addition of Tokyo to the company’s Apple Music Studio network. “This past year has seen us really lean into what we do best,” Newman says. “The thing that has always differentiated us is our editorial strength across the world.” In constructing the 100 best albums, “we pulled together an enormous editorial feature that [included] votes from our Apple Music editorial teams across the world,” she adds, “as well as a range of other expert opinions — musicians, songwriters, producers, managers and music journalists.” As for the Tokyo studio, “Japan is such an important market for us, and bringing an Apple Music Radio studio online there expanded our Apple Music Studio network to seven studio spaces worldwide.”</p>
<p>Andy Sloan-VincentHead of global music programsManuela WurmHead of global editorialKossy NgHead of music, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong and TaiwanJungJoo ParkHead of music, Korea, Spotify</p>
<p>Spotify has been leaning into superfan communities more, and this past year, the company’s work with South Korean boy band Seventeen illustrates that determination to “build deeper connections with their fans around the world,” as Park puts it. That included a first-ever countdown page and listening parties in Indonesia, as well as in-person fan experiences at the group’s shows in Seoul; New York; Tokyo; Manila, Philippines; and Jakarta, Indonesia, among others. “It was an incredible journey that not only brought fans closer to the group,” Park says, “but also helped boost their global presence and streaming numbers on Spotify.”</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “If we had to sum up the music business today in two words, they’d be ‘innovative’ and ‘ever-evolving,’ ” Park says. “The industry is rapidly embracing new technologies, and we’re seeing a surge in artist-driven content that -pushes creative boundaries.”</p>
<p>Labels &amp; Distributors</p>
<p>Rebecca AllenPresident, audience and media division, Universal Music U.K.</p>
<p>Universal Music U.K. combined its leading labels under Island EMI Label Group and Polydor Label Group last year and launched an audience and media division helmed by Allen to work across artists and labels. She will -continue collaborating with some of the acts she aided in her former EMI role alongside Jo Charrington, including English singer Olivia Dean. Allen describes Dean as “the definition of a world-class artist,” noting, “We saw just how hard Olivia and her manager, Emily [Braham], worked to connect with audiences beyond the U.K. Her Coachella and Glastonbury moments, for me, were a huge highlight in 2024.”</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “The lack of funding for the arts in schools. Our pipeline of talent into this industry, into the creative industries, will be decimated without a real investment into young people and creativity. The funding crisis for the arts in schools needs to be addressed, and as an industry, we must step up and play a role in this.”</p>
<p>Tricia ArnoldExecutive vp of global artist and label services and salesPrashant BahadurExecutive vp/head of strategyChris ManningManaging director, U.K. and Europe, The Orchard</p>
<p>Emphasizing The Orchard’s global reach, Arnold points to Japan’s YOASOBI playing pivotal shows in the United States, including appearances at the 2024 Coachella and Lollapalooza festivals and a sold-out Radio City Music Hall gig in New York last August. In addition, Mexican superstar Peso Pluma’s second album, Exodo, charted at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 on the Top Latin Albums chart and had the biggest ever debut for a Mexican artist on Spotify. The Orchard also celebrated the No. 20 debut on the Billboard 200 for Mexico’s Tito Double P’s Incomodo (the album later peaked at No. 11), BINI becoming the first Filipino winner of best Asia act at the MTV Europe Music Awards and British singer RAYE winning six BRIT Awards, scoring three Grammy noms and putting on show&ndash;stopping performances at the Grammys and Academy Awards.</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Global, in the truest sense of the word,” Arnold says.</p>
<p>Bang Si-HyukChairmanJason Jaesang LeeCEO, HYBEJonghyun KahCEO, HYBE Latin AmericaYoung Jae ShinPresident, BigHit MusicYoo Jin OhGM, HYBE 360</p>
<p>While HYBE boasts an artist roster with BTS (and its members’ solo releases), Tomorrow X Together and NewJeans, its global expansion gets a boost from an unlikely source: AI. Supertone, an AI audio company that HYBE acquired in 2023, launched virtual pop group SYNDI8 and enhanced Tomorrow X Together’s concert videos with multilingual pronunciation technology. Lee thinks that AI benefits musicians, but its regulation isn’t keeping pace with technological advances. “I believe the future of the industry will be shaped by how deliberately and appropriately we design the utilization and regulation of -technology,” he says.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “The music industry as a whole is still undervalued,” Lee says. “A simple calculation reveals this: The hourly cost of streaming is remarkably low compared with other forms of entertainment and services. It affects not only the revenue of companies but also the people who work in the music industry — from creators to the staff on the ground — who aren’t being compensated for their true worth.”</p>
<p>Kimberly BedoyaHead of Latin marketing, Roc Nation Distribution</p>
<p>The recently launched Roc Nation Distribution “has provided a solution for indie artists to distribute their music globally,” Bedoya says. “We’ve significantly strengthened our international presence through strategic partnerships and collaborations and successfully executed global marketing campaigns for high-profile music artists.” That includes Dominican rapper-singer Yailin La Más Viral, whose viral song “Bing Bong” trended at No. 1 on YouTube across multiple markets, Bedoya says, and “demonstrated our expertise in managing large-scale international initiatives and deepened our relationships with global partners and media platforms across Latin America, Europe and North America.”</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Innovative. The music business today is transforming, driven by rapid technological advances, new platforms and the shift of consumer behaviors.”</p>
<p>Louis BloomPresident, Island EMI Label Group, Universal Music U.K.</p>
<p>Not even halfway through 2025, Bloom already calls it “Chappell Roan’s year.” After Roan picked up two BRIT Awards in March, her song “Pink Pony Club” ruled the Official Singles Chart in the United Kingdom for two weeks, “proving that Chappell’s music is utterly timeless,” he adds. Meanwhile, Roan’s 2023 album, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, has spent 41 weeks in the top 10 on the Official Albums Chart. Bloom says “another remarkable achievement” is the Wicked soundtrack breaking “the U.K. chart record for the longest consecutive reign at No. 1 on the Official Compilations Chart, staying on top for an unprecedented 16 weeks.”</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Three words: relentless yet edifying.”</p>
<p>Alec BoatengPresident, 0207 Def Jam, Universal Music U.K.</p>
<p>Last summer, veteran electronic duo Chase &amp; Status and rapper Stormzy teamed up for “Backbone,” which hit No. 1 on the Official Singles Chart in the United Kingdom. “Seeing this song [a joint release with EMI] have international reach is amazing, and obviously, the fact it was such a huge No. 1 in the U.K. is something we’re really proud of,” Boateng says. “Given the range of choices facing an artist nowadays,” he continues, 0207 Def Jam is focused on providing “bespoke individual services of quality to each artist that we work with.” In the music industry now, “everyone has a different time in which the moment happens,” according to Boateng. “And patience is required for those who take a longer time to get there.”</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Unpredictable.”</p>
<p>Joseph ChangCo-CEO, Kakao EntertainmentDaniel JangDmitry YJ TakCo-CEOs, SM Entertainment</p>
<p>“Over the past few months, Kakao Entertainment has solidified its position as a key player in the K-pop scene,” Chang says. Finding a new twist on the K-pop model, Kakao’s joint venture with SM Entertainment launched a five-member British boy band, dearALICE, which reached No. 2 on the U.K. Official Physical Singles Chart with its debut single, “Ariana.” Both companies had successful world tours, too. Kakao’s IVE staged its first large-scale world tour and played to 420,000 fans in 28 cities across the globe, according to SM. SM’s aespa did its second world tour from June 2024 to March 2025, staging 43 concerts in 28 cities.</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “ ‘Boundary-breaking’ is the word that best describes today’s music industry,” Chang says. “The industry is no longer hemmed in by walls of language, nationality, platform or genre.”</p>
<p>Jo CharringtonPresident, Capitol Records, Universal Music U.K.Kieran ThurgoodExecutive vp of global marketing, Capitol Music Group</p>
<p>Working closely with U.S. labels — Capitol, Island and Mercury — has paid off in breaking U.K. artists stateside, Charrington says, as evidenced by the success of DJ-producer Sammy Virji. “Sammy played Coachella [in April] and is set to play two dates at Brooklyn Mirage in June,” Charrington says, adding that British neo-soul singer Olivia Dean is touring the United States and opening for Sabrina Carpenter at Madison Square Garden in New York in October. For Thurgood, global campaigns for songs by Good Neighbours, Quavo &amp; Lana Del Rey, Ice Spice and Troye Sivan have all yielded global hits, as well as his team’s work on the meteoric ascent of Doechii, whose latest hit, “Anxiety,” just topped the global Spotify charts, “with 70% of consumption originating outside the U.S.,” he says.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “Pointedly, achieving optimal success for our artists and portfolio of labels fundamentally relies on aggressively, but authentically, driving and harnessing the power of superfandom,” Thurgood says.</p>
<p>Brianne DeslippeSenior vp of marketing, Big Loud Records</p>
<p>At Big Loud, “we scaled our international business rapidly this year with aggressive global marketing efforts, promotional events, creative social and digital campaigns, multiformat radio No. 1s and nearly 250 tour dates and festivals,” Deslippe says. Morgan Wallen’s One Night at a Time World Tour spanned 10 countries and 87 shows, while other Big Loud artists including Stephen Wilson Jr., Dylan Gossett, Ashley Cooke, Charles Wesley Godwin and Kashus Culpepper experienced growth in global market reception, driving surges in streaming and audience numbers. Still, Deslippe says of the obstacles in marketing rising talents, “Discoverability is a constant challenge as new artists fight for attention in overcrowded spaces.”</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Evolving.”</p>
<p>Sipho DlaminiPresident/managing director, gamma.</p>
<p>Dlamini and his team signed over 35 distribution deals across Africa and the Middle East, establishing the company’s presence in the latter region by producing Steve Harvey’s Open Fire Food Festival in collaboration with BET Africa. He also A&amp;R’d a remixed track by Tamela Mann by bringing in South African amapiano/3-step producer Mörda. They also opened gamma.’s first office in Lagos, Nigeria, offering full label services and local representation for its distribution platform Vydia, and formed strategic partnerships with Sol Generation (Kenya’s leading label, owned by Sauti Sol) and Gallo Music Group (South Africa’s oldest and largest independent label).</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Confused.”</p>
<p>Denzyl FeigelsonCo-founder/CEO, Platoon</p>
<p>Last year, Platoon, the Apple-owned artist services, A&amp;R and music distribution company, increased its efforts to provide career-boosting services to acts worldwide by delving into the classical world. These efforts paid off in November, when the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Gustavo Dudamel’s Fandango album featuring violinist Anne Akiko Meyers and composer Arturo Márquez won two classical categories at the Latin Grammy Awards, and again in February, when Gabriela Ortiz’s Revolución Diamantina with Dudamel and the L.A. Phil spotlighting violinist María Dueñas took home an unprecedented three Grammy Awards, including best orchestral performance.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “There are of course multiple issues and, in turn, opportunities,” Feigelson says. “One that is top of mind is the perception of quick overnight success versus career development.”</p>
<p>Arthur FitzgibbonManaging director, BrazilAndrés López-QuirogaExecutive vp of business development, Latin Iberia, ONErpm</p>
<p>“ONErpm has continued to grow and establish itself as a modern label for artists at various stages of their careers,” including local, international and global acts, “demonstrating that our global structure, technology and flexible deal structures benefit both artists and the current industry landscape,” López-Quiroga says. He points to international success with hits like Chance Peña and Andres Castro’s “Vaquero Vaquero,” Chimbala’s “Che Che,” Brytiago’s “Kilerito” and emerging artist Alejo. “Our ability to rapidly adapt to the evolving industry landscape — leveraging our technology, global and organizational structures — and flexible deal structures,” he adds, “has enabled ONErpm to increase its global market share while maintaining a top five position in various markets worldwide.”</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Ever-changing,” López-Quiroga says.</p>
<p>Kenny GatesCo-founder/CEO, [PIAS]</p>
<p>In October last year, [PIAS] co-founder/CEO Gates and co-founder Michel Lambot sold their remaining shares of the indie label group to Universal Music Group to support their dream of offering truly global distribution services to the independent music community. Six months later, Gates says the partnership has allowed [PIAS] to retain its autonomy and core values while becoming “an added dimension in the UMG ecosystem,” as [PIAS] has continued to demonstrate its commitment to artists through recent successes like Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds’ new album, Wild God, and the breakout success of controversial Irish hip-hop act Kneecap.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “Getting access to media and to engaged audiences for truly great and passionate artists is becoming harder and harder as the DSPs and the market generally become ever more overwhelmed with the sheer volume of mediocrity clogging the system.”</p>
<p>Jonas HaentjesCEO, Edel</p>
<p>One of the biggest independent music companies in Europe, Edel owns several labels (earMUSIC, dance-focused Kontor Records), a sizable vinyl pressing plant (Optimal Media, which also manufactures CDs, DVDs and books) and a distribution operation. Last year, sales were down 7.7% overall, but with a 3.2% increase in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and strong growth in digital distribution, balanced by a stable manufacturing business. The vinyl business suffers from overcapacity, but “everyone knows us, everyone trusts us, and we’re trying to push our process further,” Haentjes says.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “We really need to watch out with what we allow the AI companies to do.”</p>
<p>Tor HansenCo-founder/executive, RedeyePelle ErikssonManaging director, Border Music/Redeye</p>
<p>As leaders of the Swedish indie distributor Redeye, Hansen and Eriksson have spent the past year streamlining how music from their global label partners reaches fans around the world — from physical products at retailers to DSPs — and focusing on products delivered to stores in Scandinavia. “We have intensified our efforts on spreading the news, and the music, from local independent labels we work with throughout the world,” Eriksson says. “The key to keep the physical part of the industry alive and well is to continue to offer quality products, vinyl and CD — at fair prices, all to keep the record-buying public happy.”</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “For the Scandinavia market, I would say, ‘Steady,’ ” Eriksson says. “For Border’s international releases, I would say, ‘Growing.’ ”</p>
<p>Paul HitchmanCOOBen AkinbolaHead of growth, AWAL</p>
<p>“Last year, marquee AWAL artists like Jungle [in the United Kingdom] and The Beaches [in Canada] — winners of group of the year honors at the BRIT Awards and Juno Awards, respectively — reached new heights in their careers internationally. Building off those international successes, we now also have local artists charting on every inhabitable continent, with a presence on the ground in over 15 markets,” Akinbola says, pointing to successes in South Africa with Yanga Chief, the Philippines with Zae and India with Loka. “All of our successes are ultimately the combination of AWAL’s unique model for artist development, our partnership with local Sony Music teams in growth markets and, most importantly, an incredible roster of independent artists who continuously push creative boundaries.”</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Democratization,” Akinbola says.</p>
<p>Ed HowardBriony TurnerCo-presidents, Atlantic Records U.K.Samantha StrumDirector of global marketing, Atlantic Records</p>
<p>Thanks to the campaign waged by Charli xcx and Atlantic, 2024 became known in multiple markets as the year of Brat Summer. “We helped to define culture,” Howard says of the campaign’s bright green aesthetic that “took over everything from fashion, sports, U.S. politics and beyond.” He adds, “Charli is a great example of a long-term artist development. Having signed with Atlantic at just 15, she’s had the time and backing to develop with artistic freedom, pushing the boundaries of alternative pop.” Looking ahead, Turner is excited about the U.K. signings of Kingfishr and Yaelokre, plus artist Alex Warren, whose “Ordinary” hit No. 1 on the Official Singles Chart in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “We increasingly face challenges in maintaining and expanding our [U.K.] export reach due to a combination of political, economic and competitive factors,” Howard says.</p>
<p>Manu KaushishPresident of international, Create Music Group</p>
<p>In June 2024, Create Music Group reached a significant milestone when it received a $160 million investment from Chicago-based private equity firm Flexpoint Ford. The move elevated CMG to “unicorn” status after getting a $1 billion valuation. The capital allowed CMG to acquire the catalogs of deadmau5 and his label, mau5trap. Founded in 2015, CMG includes marketing agency Flighthouse and independent music distribution platform Engine Label, which handled Ye and Ty Dolla $ign’s Billboard 200 No. 1 Vultures 1. “We are poised for continued aggressive expansion in 2025, empowering and onboarding even more international artists and labels,” Kaushish says.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “How to adequately and fairly compensate music creators in a world of ever-changing streaming royalties and algorithms, especially with the dominance and power that DSPs and their stakeholders have right now.”</p>
<p>Joe KentishPresident, Warner Records U.K.Luke ArmitageSenior vp of global marketing, Warner Records (Export Marketing)</p>
<p>Warner Records delivered a strong performance in the United Kingdom and globally in 2024. Dua Lipa and Coldplay headlined Glastonbury, which was streamed worldwide for the first time. With Radical Optimism, Lipa also attained “massive global success with [over] 3 billion streams and a sold-out global tour,” while Coldplay’s Moon Music “became the fastest-selling album of 2024 by a British act,” Kentish says. Also of note: Linkin Park’s From Zero comeback album notched No. 1 debuts in multiple countries including the United Kingdom, Australia and France; Benson Boone landed a No. 1 on the U.K. Official Singles Chart with “Beautiful Things”; and Teddy Swims ushered in 2025 with his first No. 1 album in Australia, I’ve Tried Everything but Therapy (Part 2).</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “On a broader level, it’s the decoupling of artists and their narratives from their songs,” Kentish says. “The way music is consumed today makes it increasingly challenging to tell important new stories through those channels.”</p>
<p>Lyn KoppeExecutive vp of global catalogCharlie StanfordSenior vp of international, commercial music group, Sony Music Entertainment</p>
<p>Sony Music’s global catalog team is “truly exceptional and inspiring,” says Koppe, who manages the expansive Legacy Recordings/Sony Music catalog. “With the privilege of overseeing some of the most iconic music from the last 100-plus years, our team focuses on innovating, sharing learnings and developing best practices among countries as trusted collaborators.” Meanwhile, Stanford says his purview across all of Sony Music’s international catalog continued to expand thanks to several of the company’s major acquisitions. “As always,” Koppe adds, “our passion for music, our artists and their fans remains the top priority guiding our strategies around the world.”</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “Fans have a lot of choice,” Stanford says, “so from a catalog perspective, we must focus on developing unique and authentic ways to cut through and help audiences discover decades of incredible music from around the world.”</p>
<p>Ben LarsenExecutive vp of international, Interscope Geffen A&amp;M</p>
<p>“Being given license to reimagine how we develop artist careers globally and how we do business around the world has meant that my team and I are able to evolve the partnerships with our UMG affiliates to greater effect,” Larsen says. That freedom played an integral role in paving a two-way-street — creative and execution — that delivered “amazing results” over the last year. As examples, Larsen cites Lady Gaga, Kendrick Lamar and Playboi Carti, who had “some of the biggest global rollouts in years, topping album and singles charts.” Then to also see Gracie Abrams “break through with a huge No. 1 single [“That’s So True”] all over the world is exciting,” Larsen adds, “and sets the tone for what’s to come.”</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Relentless.”</p>
<p>Federico LauriaFounder/CEO, Dale Play</p>
<p>The Argentina-based company made impressive gains across its divisions: Dale Play Management, Dale Play Records and Dale Play Live. On the management side, Lauria’s marquee client Duki became the first rapper — and only Argentine artist — to sell out Madrid’s Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. Meanwhile, Lauria says Dale Play Live sold over 1 million tickets in Argentina alone during 2024, promoting shows for global acts Travis Scott and Karol G, to name a few. Furthermore, Dale Play Records — home to artists like Cazzu and Paulo Londra — and Bad Bunny’s Rimas Entertainment teamed for a strategic alliance, “playing a key role in developing and amplifying a new wave of Spanish-language urban music around the world,” Lauria adds.</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Passion. At least in Dale Play, that’s our engine. It’s what drives every risk, every idea and every action. Without it, nothing else works.”</p>
<p>Nando LuacesFounder/CEO, Altafonte</p>
<p>Since Sony Music Group’s acquisition of Altafonte in January 2024, “we continue to operate independently but have all the financial capacity and know-how to grow in a very competitive and dynamic market,” Luaces says. On industry challenges, Luaces emphasizes adapting to technological advances: “AI and the challenge of how to be fair in royalty payments for streaming is the problem of today, and we must solve it,” he says. “In order to have a prosperous and larger business, we continue to adapt to changes and technological advances, as has been the history of music for the last 130 years.”</p>
<p>The music business today in a word: “Acceptance. Accept that the world is unstable and changing. Anything can happen.”</p>
<p>Roni Maltz BinFounder/CEO, Sua Música Group</p>
<p>Brazilian indie distributor Sua, known for its focus on independent regional artists, has now begun its “international expansion into the Latin market,” Maltz Bin says, noting that the company has plans to launch labels in key territories including Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Mexico in the next 24 months. In December, Sua opened a recording studio and urban music label Único Música in Buenos Aires, Argentina, for emerging talent. The -company also hired its first A&amp;R executive in Medellín, Colombia, with plans to launch a label there. “There has never been a time with so many opportunities in the music industry for artists, producers, labels, record companies and entrepreneurs,” Maltz Bin says. “We are living in the golden era of the music business.”</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “The two biggest challenges are the rise of AI-powered tools and the increasing amount of artificial streaming and fraud.”</p>
<p>Martin MillsChairmanPaul ReddingCOOBrandon BeckerGlobal vp of streaming, Beggars GroupJean-Philippe AlineGM, Beggars FranceBen BeardsworthManaging director, XL RecordingsCaius PawsonFounder, Young</p>
<p>In 2024, XL Recordings worked closely with The Smile, as well as DJ Peggy Gou. “(It Goes Like) Nanana,” Gou’s debut release for XL, topped singles charts around the globe ahead of the 2024 release of her acclaimed solo album, I Hear You. Mills is particularly proud of how Beggars Group also helped take Irish band Fontaines D.C. “to the next level.” Last September, the band made its Billboard 200 debut with its fourth album, Romance (released on XL Recordings), which peaked at No. 2 on the U.K. Official Albums Chart. Meanwhile, lead single “Starburster” became a top 20 hit on the Alternative and Triple A airplay charts. As Mills says, “It was a major global success story that we are all very proud of.”</p>
<p>Biggest issue: “The biggest issue is money,” Mills says. “Commerce and art have always been uncomfortable bedfellows, never more so than now.”</p>
<p>Ben MortimerPresident, Polydor Label Group, Universal Music U.K.</p>
<p>Mortimer’s focus over the last year was “integrating the incredible artist rosters and executive talent at Capitol Records and 0207 Def Jam into the Polydor world.” He says, “It’s gone remarkably smoothly, which is a testament to all involved.” Polydor star Sam Fender also released his People Watching album, which channels classic heartland rock; it hit the top of the U.K. Official Albums Chart with 107,000 chart units — the biggest opening week for a British solo act since 2022. Fender will play select stadium shows in the United Kingdom this summer.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “Vying for attention amid the breadth of music from around the world. However, the U.K. has always punched above its weight creatively, and I feel we are on the cusp of a new wave of breakthrough British talent.”</p>

<p>“EMPIRE has made significant strides in bridging global music markets, fostering cross-cultural collaborations and amplifying diverse voices,” including a “strong foundation in the African music scene,” Nafar says, citing as an example Moroccan rapper Dada and Sudanese rapper Soulja recording an Arabic remix of Los Angeles rapper 310babii’s 2024 Rhythmic Airplay No. 1 breakout hit, “Soak City (Do It).” And signing some of the biggest acts in South Korea and Southeast Asia like K-pop icon G-Dragon has further cemented “EMPIRE’s reputation as a key player in shaping the future of the global music industry,” he adds.</p>
<p>Biggest issue now: “Instead of merely capitalizing on what performs well in the data,” Nafar says, “the industry must do better in nurturing and developing talent, ensuring that artistry and innovation remain at the heart of the music business.”</p>

<p>“This year, we brought our storytelling passion to life with exciting global soundtrack campaigns for two highly anticipated films, Moana 2 and Mufasa: The Lion King,” Novakovic says, adding that last year, Disney made the soundtracks available in 29 languages, “ensuring that the magic of these stories reaches cultures worldwide.” Earlier in 2025, the company introduced the soundtrack to Disney’s Snow White, “a captivating addition to our repertoire that continues to celebrate the timeless tales that have inspired generations,” he says. Novakovic also notes the momentum of pop trio almost monday, which wrapped a sold-out 19-city headlining run through Europe.</p>
<p>The music business today in a word “Abundant — overflowing with creativity, talent and opportunity across a constantly expanding global landscape.”</p>
