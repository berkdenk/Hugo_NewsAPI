<p>Edo indigenes make passionate appeal to Osimhen</p>
<p>Some self-identified indigenes of Edo State have made a heartfelt appeal to Super Eagles striker Victor Osimhen, urging him to support his kinsmen in Okhuesan.</p>
<p>Family members in the community have claimed that the Galatasaray forward has distanced himself from them since rising to prominence in both club and international football.</p>
<p>Yusuf Sakiru specifically called on the former Lille star to assist his father’s relatives, who he says are living in poor conditions.</p>
<p>He added that many footballers and celebrities extend philanthropic gestures even to those outside their families, and encouraged Osimhen to do the same. He said:</p>
<p>“Victor Osimhen please listen to good advice here, kindly assist your immediate Parents' family.</p>
<p>“It&rsquo;s not necessary you travel down home before doing that Almighty Allah have blessed you give what belong to Cezar to Cezar.</p>
<p>“Again you are the only Celebrity that will be helping his or her people in the village, we have had Some people&rsquo;s before you please do the needful God will surely guiding you and you shall not fall down in your life Amin.\&quot;</p>
<p>In the same vein, Ken Igbokwe urged Victor Osimhen to follow the footsteps of football stars like Didier Drogba, Yaya Toure and Sadio Mane who give back to their community. He said:</p>
<p>“God pick him for a purpose. Mane is been love by his people bc of the charity works he is doing for his village people. Go to dider Drogba and yaya village and see charity begins at home.”</p>
<p>Mixed reaction trails Edo indigenes' suggestions</p>
<p>Legit.ng compiled some of the comments that trailed the post. Read them below:</p>
<p>Okotie Emmanuel Allen said:</p>
<p>\&ldquo;Success has relative, but failure is an orphan. Osimhen go and locate your root and associate with them, you might need them someday.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>Michael Dosumu replied</p>
<p>\&ldquo;Osimhen na Yoruba man leave him alone, not an ungrateful fellow like many of you that grow up in the west but still condemn the people.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oshili Chinedu added:</p>
<p>\&ldquo;Nothing like that, when he was nobody, who helped him( Osimhen.v.).\&rdquo;</p>
<p>Effiong Mbom questioned:</p>
<p>\&ldquo;Who root help? They want to bewitch him.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Rukevwe Ogbodu wrote:</p>
<p>\&ldquo;Where were the Okhuesan elders when he was hawking pure water in the streets of Olusosun in Lagos, and was cleaning gutter for N20, they didn&rsquo;t know him and his father then, it is now they know him.\&rdquo;</p>
<p>Osimhen reportedly offered ₦1.3 billion weekly</p>
<p>Legit.ng earlier reported that amid speculation about Victor Osimhen&rsquo;s next club, he could make headlines with one of the most lucrative contracts in football history.</p>
<p>Reports suggested that Saudi Pro League giants, Al-Hilal, had made an offer of ₦1.3 billion per week to try and lure the Nigerian international away from Europe.</p>
<p>The club was reportedly prepared to not only meet Napoli’s €75 million release clause, applied to non-Italian clubs, but also tabled a huge annual salary for Osimhen.</p>
