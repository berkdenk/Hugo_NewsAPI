    <div align="start" class="content"><p>A peculiar moment between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and French President Emmanuel Macron during the European Political Community (EPC) summit in Albania has taken social media by storm.
In the widely circulated video, Erdogan is seen gripping Macron’s hand and gently patting it — but what captured attention was how he unexpectedly held onto Macron’s index finger, even as the French leader attempted to pull away.
Macron Appears Uncomfortable as Erdogan Holds His Finger
The exchange began innocently with a handshake, but when Macron reached out with his other hand, Erdogan, while still seated, grasped Macron&rsquo;s index finger and continued speaking. For the next 13 seconds, Macron appeared visibly uneasy as he subtly tried to withdraw his hand, all while Erdogan maintained his grip before finally releasing it.
The video has led to a flurry of speculation online, with many interpreting Erdogan’s gesture as a subtle assertion of dominance. Social media users debated whether the finger-holding was a calculated display of power or simply an awkward moment captured on camera.
Turkish media outlets offered an alternative perspective, claiming Macron had placed his hand on Erdogan’s shoulder in a move seen as an attempt to assert psychological dominance. In response, Erdogan reportedly reacted by firmly holding Macron’s finger, signaling his refusal to be outmaneuvered in body language.
