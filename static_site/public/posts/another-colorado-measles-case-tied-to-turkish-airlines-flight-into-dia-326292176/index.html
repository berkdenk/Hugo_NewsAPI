        <h2>Another Colorado measles case tied to Turkish Airlines flight into DIA</h2>
        <h5></h5>
        

    </div>

    <div align="start" class="content"><p>A second Arapahoe County resident who was likely exposed to measles on a flight that landed at Denver International Airport has tested positive for the disease, Colorado public health officials said Thursday.</p>
<p>The state’s seventh measles case of the year was confirmed in a vaccinated adult who was a passenger on Turkish Airlines flight 201 from Istanbul, which landed at DIA on May 13.</p>
<p>An out-of-state passenger on the flight had measles and was at the airport, a hotel shuttle and a nearby Quality Inn and Suites on May 13 and 14, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.</p>
<p>An Arapahoe County child younger than 5 who was also a passenger on the flight previously tested positive for measles.</p>
<p>Public health officials are contacting passengers and crew members who were seated near the person who had measles as well as all children who were sitting on their parents’ laps.</p>
<p>People who visited parts of Denver, Aurora, Greenwood Village and Evergreen last week and weekend may have been exposed, officials said.</p>
<p>Known exposure locations:</p>
<p>Casa Vallarta, 4002 S. Parker Road in Aurora, from 5:30 to 8:30 p.m. May 22.
Colorado Athletic Club Denver Tech Center, 5555 DTC Parkway in Greenwood Village, from 4 to 8 p.m. May 23.
Country Fair Garden Center, 7150 Leetsdale Drive #414 in Denver, from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Saturday.
Golden Saigon Restaurant, 2648 S. Parker Road, Unit 2 in Aurora, from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. Saturday.
Comfort Suites Golden West, 29300 U.S. 40 in Evergreen, from 1 to 6 p.m. Sunday and 10:30 p.m. Sunday until 8:30 a.m. Monday.
Evergreen Wine and Liquor, 29017 Hotel Way in Evergreen, from 2:30 to 4:30 p.m. Sunday.</p>
<p>Anyone who may have been exposed should monitor themselves for symptoms for 21 days or through June 17. Symptoms can include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash that usually starts several days later on the face and spreads.</p>
<p>Measles is highly contagious but preventable with the MMR vaccine, public health officials said in a news release. It’s rare for a vaccinated person who is exposed to get the disease — that happens in only about three out of 100 cases, and symptoms are usually milder and less contagious.</p>
<p>Colorado has confirmed six other measles cases this year, the most since 1996, including in Pueblo, Denver and Archuleta counties.</p>
<p>Colorado and Arapahoe County public health officials are hosting free MMR vaccine clinics for people exposed to measles, including from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m. Friday at Altura Plaza, 15400 E. 14th Place in Aurora and 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday at Aurora Community Connection, 9801 E. Colfax Ave. in Aurora. The clinic will be in the courtyard behind the building.</p>
