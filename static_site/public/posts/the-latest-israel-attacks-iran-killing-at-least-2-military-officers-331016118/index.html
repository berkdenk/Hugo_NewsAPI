        <h2>The Latest: Israel attacks Iran, killing at least 2 military officers</h2>
        <h5></h5>
        

    </div>

    <div align="start" class="content"><p>By The Associated Press</p>
<p>Israel launched a wave of strikes across Iran on Friday that targeted its nuclear program and military sites, killing at least two top military officers and raising the prospect of an all-out war between the two bitter Middle East adversaries.</p>
<p>It appeared to be the most significant attack Iran has faced since its 1980s war with Iraq.</p>
<p>Iran quickly retaliated, sending a swarm of drones at Israel as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned of “severe punishment.”</p>
<p>The attack comes as tensions reached new heights over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program. The Board of Governors at the International Atomic Energy Agency for the first time in 20 years on Thursday censured Iran over it not working with its inspectors. Iran immediately announced it would establish a third enrichment site in the country and swap out some centrifuges for more advanced ones.</p>
<p>Israeli leaders cast the attack as necessary to head off an imminent threat that Iran would build nuclear bombs, though it remains unclear how close the country is to achieving that.</p>
<p>Here’s the latest:</p>
<p>Israeli military said it hit ‘underground command center’</p>
<p>The Israeli military said military jets hit a site where Revolutionary Guard officials had “assembled in an underground command center,” allegedly “to prepare for an attack on the state of Israel,” and killed Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh along with two other senior officials.</p>
<p>It did not offer details or information to support the claim.</p>
<p>“Hajizadeh publicly declared his commitment to Israel’s destruction at various events in recent years and played a central role in developing the Iranian regime’s plan for Israel’s destruction,” the Israelis said.</p>
<p>It also linked those killed to an attack on Saudi Arabia in 2019.</p>
<p>Israel claims it killed head of Revolutionary Guard missile program</p>
<p>Israel claimed Friday it killed Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the Revolutionary Guard’s missile program in Iran.</p>
<p>Iran did not immediately acknowledge his death officially, though rumors of his death had been circulating for some time online.</p>
<p>Hajizadeh is a major commander within the Guard, overseeing its ballistic missile arsenal.</p>
<p>Museums in Iran close after attacks</p>
<p>Museums in Iran are taking the extraordinary step of closing down until further notice after attacks by Israel, and were transferring valuable items to secure vaults, officials announced Friday.</p>
<p>The state-affiliated Borna news agency reported the order by Ali Darabi, Iran’s deputy minister and cultural heritage chief.</p>
<p>Such moves have been done only in extraordinary circumstances in Iran, including the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Trump urges Iran to reach nuclear deal with Washington</p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump is again urging Iran to reach a deal with Washington on its nuclear program, warning that Israel’s attacks “will only get worse.”</p>
<p>In his first public comments since the Friday attacks, Trump said on his Truth Social platform that “there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end.”</p>
<p>Hezbollah says Israel has ‘crossed all red lines’</p>
<p>The Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has accused the U.S. of providing “approval, coordination, and direct cover-up” for Israel’s strikes, adding that Israel “has crossed all red lines, believing that by doing so, it will change the equations.”</p>
<p>In a statement, the group issued condolences to Tehran for the leaders who were killed, but did not threaten to join in the retaliation.</p>
<p>Jordan says strikes push region into more tension</p>
<p>Jordan’s state media says the country’s foreign minister has discussed Israel’s strikes on Iran with his Egyptian counterpart, and warned that the attack pushes the region into more tension and conflict.</p>
<p>Jordan News Agency said the ministers called the strikes a “dangerous escalation and a flagrant violation of international law.”</p>
<p>The ministers also said Israel’s attacks on the Gaza Strip should stop to and a two-state solution is needed to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Egypt and Jordan are among Arab countries that signed peace treaties with Israel and have normal relations with it.</p>
<p>EU’s top diplomat calls for de-escalation in the Middle East</p>
<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called the fresh outbreak of violence in the Middle East “deeply alarming.”</p>
<p>“Europe urges all parties to exercise maximum restraint, de-escalate immediately and refrain from retaliation. A diplomatic resolution is now more urgent than ever, for the sake of the region’s stability and global security,” she said in a post on the Bluesky social media platform.</p>
<p>Iran names replacements for commanders killed in strikes</p>
<p>Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has replaced two top military commanders killed in a wave of Israeli strikes on Friday.</p>
<p>State TV said he tapped Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi as the new head of the armed forces, replacing Gen. Mohammad Bagheri. Mousavi was previously the top army commander.</p>
<p>Khamenei chose Mohammad Pakpour to lead the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, replacing Gen. Hossein Salami.</p>
<p>Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, created after its 1979 Islamic Revolution, is one of the main power centers within the country’s theocracy.</p>
<p>Israeli officials say they smuggled weapons into Iran ahead of strikes</p>
<p>Israeli security officials say the country’s Mossad spy agency smuggled weapons into Iran ahead of Friday’s strikes that were used to target its defenses from within.</p>
<p>Two security officials spoke on condition of anonymity on Friday to discuss the highly secretive missions. It was not possible to independently confirm their claims. There was no official comment.</p>
<p>The officials said a base for launching explosive drones was established inside Iran and that the drones were activated during Friday’s attack to target missile launchers at an Iranian base near Tehran.</p>
<p>They said Israel had also smuggled precision weapons into central Iran and positioned them near surface-to-air missile systems. They said it also deployed strike systems on vehicles. Both were activated as the strikes began, in order to target Iran’s defenses, the officials said.</p>

<p>Italy urges Israel to avoid escalation</p>
<p>Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said he has urged Israel’s foreign minister in a call to avoid escalation. He added that he would make the same request to Iran’s foreign minister when they speak later Friday.</p>
<p>Tajani called for “proportionality, calm and prudence,” as well as the urgent resumption of talks to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem is closed to the public</p>
<p>With gates to the Al-Aqsa mosque closed by Israeli police, only the guards and employees of the holy site will be present for traditional Friday prayers, the site’s custodian said Friday.</p>
<p>The mosque is the third holiest site for Muslims, and is located on the holiest site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount.</p>
<p>The Waqf, the Islamic endowment which administers the site, said Israel has banned public gatherings. The call to prayer will sound as usual.</p>
<p>Iraq calls on UN Security Council to ‘deter this aggression’</p>
<p>The Iraqi government in a statement called Israel’s attacks on neighboring Iran “a flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations” and a “threat to international peace and security, especially as it occurred during the period of US-Iranian negotiations.”</p>
<p>It called for the UN Security Council to convene immediately to take “decisive and concrete measures to deter this aggression, ensure its non-recurrence, and restore the prestige of the international legal system.”</p>
<p>Baghdad, which has close ties with both the U.S. and Iran, has attempted to maintain a difficult balancing act between the two.</p>
<p>Iran says nuclear enrichment facility was damaged</p>
<p>Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization said in a statement that parts of the Natanz nuclear enrichment facility were damaged during the Israeli strikes but that no nuclear radiation or chemical contamination has occurred.</p>
<p>NATO chief calls on US, other Israeli allies to press for de-escalation</p>
<p>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte called on Israel’s Western backers to press for an end to the strikes.</p>
<p>“This was a unilateral action by Israel. So I think it is crucial for many allies, including the United States, to work as we speak to de-escalate,” Rutte told reporters in Stockholm after talks with Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson.</p>
<p>Asked whether a nuclear clash might be imminent in the region, Rutte said: “No, we are not close.”</p>
<p>Israel’s defense minister threatens further attacks against Iran</p>
<p>In a statement soon after Israel’s military said it had completed the attack on Iran, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said the military would “continue its activities to thwart the Iranian nuclear program and remove threats on the State of Israel.</p>
<p>“The precise hit on the heads of the commanders of the Revolutionary Guards, the Iranian army and the nuclear scientists, who were all involved in promoting the plan to destroy Israel, is a strong and clear message — those who work to destroy Israel will be eliminated.”</p>
<p>Israeli military says widespread attack on Iranian air defenses complete</p>

<p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called on both sides to “refrain from steps that could lead to a further escalation and destabilize the whole region.”</p>
<p>Merz, who said Netanyahu informed him about the military operation in a phone call Friday morning, said Germany is ready to use “all available diplomatic means” to exert influence on the parties to the conflict.</p>
<p>He said that “the aim must remain that Iran not develop any nuclear weapons.”</p>
<p>The German leader emphasized Israel’s “right to protect its existence and the security of its citizens.”</p>
<p>He said that security authorities in Germany will increase protection for Jewish and Israeli facilities.</p>
<p>Hamas condemns Israel’s strikes on Iran</p>
<p>The Palestinian group said Friday that the strikes “form a dangerous escalation” that could lead to a regional war.</p>
<p>Hamas added that the strikes reflect the Israeli government’s intention to pull the region into an open war.</p>
<p>Jordanian state media says country intercepting missiles and drones</p>
<p>Jordanian state media said the country’s Air Force is intercepting missiles and drones in its air space.</p>
<p>The state news agency quoted an unnamed senior military official as saying that the interceptions were carried out based on military assessments indicating that the missiles and drones were likely to fall within Jordanian territory, including populated areas, posing a potential threat to civilian safety.</p>
<p>The official added that the Jordan Armed Forces are operating “around the clock to defend the country’s borders by land, sea, and air and will not allow any violation of Jordanian airspace under any circumstances.”</p>

<p>Australia and New Zealand’s governments condemned the Israeli strikes on Friday.</p>
<p>Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said she was “alarmed by the escalation” between Israel and Iran, which she said risked further destabilizing an already volatile region.</p>
<p>New Zealand’s Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said the strikes were “a huge concern” for his government and “potentially catastrophic” for the Middle East. “The risk of miscalculation is high,” he said.</p>

<p>Headquarters of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard is ablaze</p>
<p>An Israeli attack on Iran has set the headquarters of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard ablaze, state television reported Friday.</p>
<p>A reporter on air said he was unable to get closer due to the intensity of the fire in Iran’s capital, Tehran.</p>

Reed added: “I urge both nations to show immediate restraint, and I call on President Trump and our international partners to press for diplomatic de-escalation before this crisis spirals further out of control.”</p>
<p>Dozens of commercial flights over Iran as attack begins</p>
<p>Dozens of commercial airliners were in Iranian airspace as the strikes took place, according to flight tracking websites.</p>

<p>Many nations’ jets already did not overfly Iran because of regional tensions.</p>
<p>Scope of attack remains unclear</p>
<p>The extent of Israel’s strikes remained unclear early Friday.</p>
<p>Explosions could be heard across Tehran, Iran’s capital city. There were some images circulating of damaged residential buildings.</p>
<p>Iranian state television also was being careful in how they described the assault, suggesting that some areas outside of Tehran that had also been hit.</p>
<p>Netanyahu says strikes respond to threat to Israel’s survival</p>
<p>Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an address on YouTube that the country launched “a targeted military operation roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival.”</p>
<p>He added that the attacks will continue “for as many days at it takes to remove this threat.”</p>
<p>Israel closes its airspace</p>
<p>Israel closed its airspace in anticipation of Iranian retaliation.</p>
<p>Israel’s Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that attacks were expected.</p>
<p>“In the wake of the state of Israel’s preventive attack against Iran, missile and drone attacks against Israel and its civilian population are expected immediately,” he said in a statement.</p>

Let me be clear: Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel.”</p>
