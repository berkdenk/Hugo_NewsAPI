    <div align="start" class="content"><p>BAKU, Azerbaijan, June 6. The book \&ldquo;Armenian
Massacre in Igdir through the Eyes of Witnesses\&rdquo; by Ziya Zakir
Acar, head of the Association for the Survival and Support of the
Igdir-Azerbaijani Language, History and Culture Community and the
Igdir Azerbaijani House, has been published in Türkiye, the
Azerbaijani State Committee on Work with Diaspora said, Trend reports.</p>
<p>The author of the foreword to the book, published with the
committee&rsquo;s financial support, is its first deputy chairman Valeh</p>
<p>The book, intended for a wide audience in Turkish and English,
tells about the terrible massacres committed by Armenia in Igdir
and surrounding cities through the words of witnesses.</p>
<p>It provides extensive information about the subsequent fate of
Azerbaijanis who were forcibly expelled from Western Azerbaijan and
settled in Igdir in particular.</p>
<p>The facts of genocide were confirmed by the mass graves and
eyewitness accounts discovered with the participation of the
Turkish media in the towns and villages of Igdir province - Oba,
Tuzluca, Hakmehmet, Kulluk, Dize, Arapkiri and Gedikli.</p>
<p>It was noted that dozens of mass graves were also discovered in
other settlements during the excavations.</p>
<p>The publication proved with facts that present-day Armenia is an
ancient Turkish homeland and that the toponyms of Western
Azerbaijan were falsified by Armenia.</p>
