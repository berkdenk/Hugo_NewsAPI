    <div align="start" class="content"><p>I attended the recent conference on Women in Trade and Investment organised by the Women of Africa Network (WOAN) and Ecobank Ghana in collaboration with the AfCTFA Secretariat, where I spoke on \&ldquo;Building a Global Brand: Practical Branding Strategies for International Growth.\&rdquo; Given the importance of this topic, not only to women entrepreneurs but to Ghanaian businesses in general, I would like to share my thoughts here. So here we go…</p>
<p>Why Go Global?</p>
<p>Before going into the main topic on building a global brand, we first of all need to understand and appreciate why we need to go global. This is imperative because, if one does not see the need or benefit of a thing or action, then there will be no motivation to do it. Here are a few reasons why Ghanaian businesses should consider going global.</p>
<p>Increased Revenue: Going global will provide your business access to customers who are willing to pay a premium, which could lead to higher sales and profit margins, especially if you operate in an economy that is challenged or undergoing a crisis. A typical example was when we experienced the debt exchange programme that resulted in a loss of investments, disposable incomes, and purchasing power.</p>
<p>Brand Prestige &amp; Recognition: It is believed that a brand that sells internationally often gains respect and influence, even in the domestic market. It creates the perception that the brand is doing well, is of top quality and credible. Customers are attracted to successful and winning brands, giving credence to the adage that says, “If it’s good enough for the world, it must be world-class”. Consider the Ghanaian brand like Christie Brown, who showcased her fashion line at the global fashion week and is worn by Beyoncé and has been featured on Global News Networks like CNN.</p>
<p>Global Investors and Partnerships: A global presence can attract investment, partnership and collaborations by communicating to these critical stakeholders that your business is scalable, your product has a global demand and is worth investing in.</p>
<p>Empowerment and Job Creation: Closely linked to global investment and partnership is the multiplying effect this will have on your business, as your global demand means hiring more people and uplifting the community. Remember, business is not only about profitability but also sustainability.</p>
<p>What is a Brand?</p>
<p>Every time I ask this question, my students are quick to answer – It’s a logo, a name, an identity. While this is correct, a brand is more than a logo, name, or identity. A brand is what you stand for; who you are; why you are in business; and why your target audience should engage with you. Your brand is also your voice – how you communicate. This could be formal, friendly, witty, or empowering. Your brand is also a promise to deliver a specific set of benefits.</p>
<p>What is a Global Brand?</p>
<p>Drawing from the definition of a brand, one can safely assert that a global brand is a brand marketed under the same name and identity across multiple countries, with a unified purpose, appearance, and reputation, while often making local adaptations in tone, language, or presentation. This means the brand’s identity must remain consistent in both domestic and international markets. However, messages may be adjusted or refined to align with the cultural nuances of the various markets. In effect, a global brand is a brand that stays true to its identity across markets while speaking the language of the people it serves.</p>
<p>How to Build a Global Brand</p>
<p>Building a global brand in today’s digital age requires thorough research, thoughtful planning and well-coordinated execution. Below are a few simple steps to successfully expand our brand’s global presence:</p>
<p>Conduct Market Research. Scripture says in Luke 14:28, “Which of you, wishing to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost to see if he has the resources to complete it?”. This principle applies to building a global brand, and it is the first step your company must take. It is imperative to research the various markets to identify which countries you should expand into. Who are the competitors, and what are the macro and micro factors impacting business operations? In pursuit of this, it is crucial to understand the buying habits of people in the international markets.</p>
<p>Develop Your Identity: Going global means you will be competing with similar brands that may be well-known and respected for their unique services. One question a potential customer will ask is why they should do business with you. Therefore, clearly establish what makes you unique. This could be your product or service quality, your story, mission, or the experience your brand offers. Choose brand elements that are simple, memorable, aesthetically appealing, and adaptable.</p>
<p>Ensure Consistency: In branding,maintaining consistency is essential for building trust, recognition, clarity, and memorability. This is even more critical for brands that require global recognition. Your logo, tone of voice, imagery, and colour must remain uniform across all markets to facilitate recognition and recall. Consider brands like Coca-Cola, MTN, and Ecobank, among others.</p>
<p>Own a Unique Positioning: Positioning in marketing is owning a unique place in the mind of your consumers. It is how your consumers perceive you in relation to the competition. To succeed in marketing and the global market, your brand must be known for and respected for something. This is what will differentiate your brand from the competition. You must give your target audience a reason to choose you over the competition.</p>
<p>Have a Digital Presence: In this digital age, it will be suicidal to think about going global and not think about digital. Going global is not just about physically moving to a new market. One can leverage technology and the Internet to go global by developing a professional, mobile-friendly and accessible website that targets and attracts a global audience. The various social media platforms also offer another option. Businesses can use social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, and Pinterest to target and access the global market. Always remember, your digital presence is your passport to the world.</p>
<p>Exceptional Customer Experience: Creating an excellent customer experience in the global market could offer your brand a competitive edge. An exceptional customer experience could attract and influence repeat purchases, lead to referrals, and build loyalty. Brands can achieve this by creating user-friendly websites where customers can easily navigate. Secondly, product descriptions should be clear with twenty-hour service support. Having multiple payment options, simple checkout processes, and upfront shipping information with tracking services are all essential ways by which brands can deliver exceptional customer experience.</p>
<p>In conclusion, local businesses must understand that, with technological advancement, local businesses no longer have the option of choosing whether to go global or remain a local champion. The competition will be brought to you wherever you are, either physically or through the power of technology. Customers have been empowered and are well-informed via the Internet. Hence, they will read reviews, compare brands (local or international) before making a purchase decision.</p>
