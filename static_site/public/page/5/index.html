On May 30, 1845, the Fatel Razack arrived in the Gulf of Paria carrying 225 indentured labourers from India. Until 1917, thousands more would make that same journey, laying the foundation for a vibrant Indo-TT community. Today, their cultural legacy lives on in the language, food, music, religion, and the fashion of this twin-island nation.
One devout Muslim, Farzaana Mohammed, spoke to Newsday about Islamic fashion in TT. Mohammed’s fashion story began with a deep personal love for style and self-expression.</div>

            <div class="post-summary">Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor&rsquo;s recent comments—arguably ill-timed—suggested that perhaps the aid that the Kerala government sent to Turkey in 2023 was misplaced. He gives two reasons: firstly, Turkey is not a friendly nation, and secondly, the money could have been better utilised in the aftermath of a disaster in Kerala itself.The second reason can be safely ignored. We receive as much aid as we give out—there cannot be miserliness in humanitarian gestures, only moderation.</div>
