Following a fragile ceasefire after India’s bold Operation Sindoor, geopolitical tremors have rocked South Asia and the broader Islamic world. Central to this turbulence is the growing alliance between Pakistan and Turkey—a partnership now being openly challenged by India in an increasingly multipolar world.
In the latest diplomatic firestorm, India has responded with forceful economic and political retaliation after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed unwavering solidarity with Pakistan.</div>
