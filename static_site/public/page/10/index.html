The club said the Wales defender was \&ldquo;sensitive to\&rdquo; the potential impact of the picture, which was posted by his former partner Saara Sa, on the families of supporters Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight, who were murdered in Istanbul in 2000 on the eve of a UEFA Cup game against the Turkish side.</div>

            <div class="post-summary">The mother of Ethan Ampadu&rsquo;s child has slammed Leeds United for &lsquo;stating lies&rsquo; in their statement about a picture of his son wearing a Galatasaray kit. There remains an angry feeling from Leeds fans towards the Turkish side. That is due to the murders of two Whites fans - Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight - in Istanbul ahead of the 2000 UEFA Cup semi-final between the two sides. A picture has emerged in recent days of Ampadu&rsquo;s son wearing a Gala shirt.</div>
