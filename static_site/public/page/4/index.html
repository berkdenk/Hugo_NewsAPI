            <div class="post-summary">The second round of peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine concluded abruptly in Istanbul on June 2, 2025, lasting barely an hour and yielding no significant progress. The talks, held at the historic Ciragan Palace, were overshadowed by recent escalations, including a substantial Ukrainian drone strike on Russian military assets. Second Round of Russia-Ukraine Peace Talks in Istanbul Ends Abruptly Amid Escalating Tensions Turkish officials reported that the meeting commenced nearly two hours late without any official explanation.</div>

            <div class="post-summary">Growing up in my native Pakistan, I came to the conclusion that Islam was discriminatory and misogynistic. It was a religion that had been weaponised to keep independent-thinking women like me, and anyone who opposes the fundamentalists, in their place by fear.
I&rsquo;d watched, appalled, at news footage of people being lynched in the street or burned alive for raising the questions about Islam I had privately asked myself.
As Pakistan became more and more radicalised, this slowly became a routine occurrence rather than a one-off event.</div>

The state’s seventh measles case of the year was confirmed in a vaccinated adult who was a passenger on Turkish Airlines flight 201 from Istanbul, which landed at DIA on May 13.
An out-of-state passenger on the flight had measles and was at the airport, a hotel shuttle and a nearby Quality Inn and Suites on May 13 and 14, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.</div>
