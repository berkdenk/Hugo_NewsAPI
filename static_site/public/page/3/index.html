            <div class="post-summary">On June 6, 2025, Türkiye marked a critical milestone in its ongoing pursuit of defense self-sufficiency and technological autonomy. In a significant development for the Turkish defense sector, Roketsan’s Stand-Off Missile (SOM) program achieved a successful test firing with the domestically developed KTJ-3200 turbojet engine. The successful demonstration of this engine marks the full localization of the missile’s propulsion system, eliminating one of the last remaining foreign dependencies in Türkiye’s indigenous cruise missile program.</div>

Later, they sent only their best officers, adept at foreign dealings, to take care of affairs with India. They were in a strong position in Europe while Britain stood isolated despite its conquests, guarding its own, lacking the trust of its peers, amongst whom they failed to generate neither faith nor friendship.</div>
